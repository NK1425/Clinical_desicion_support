# Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis

## Classification

### Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison Disease)
- Destruction of adrenal cortex; deficiency of cortisol AND aldosterone
- Causes: Autoimmune adrenalitis (most common in developed countries), infections (TB, CMV, HIV), hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), metastatic disease, medications (ketoconazole, etomidate, mitotane)
- Distinguishing features: Hyperpigmentation, salt craving, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia

### Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency
- Deficient ACTH from pituitary pathology; cortisol deficient but aldosterone preserved
- Causes: Pituitary tumor, surgery, radiation, Sheehan syndrome, infiltrative disease
- No hyperpigmentation; no hyperkalemia (aldosterone intact)

### Tertiary Adrenal Insufficiency
- Most common form; due to chronic exogenous glucocorticoid use causing HPA axis suppression
- Risk: Any patient on >= 20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >= 3 weeks, or any dose of systemic corticosteroid for >= 4 weeks
- HPA axis recovery may take 6-12 months after discontinuation

## Diagnosis

### Biochemical Testing
- **Morning cortisol** (8 AM): <3 mcg/dL confirms adrenal insufficiency; >18 mcg/dL excludes it; 3-18 mcg/dL requires dynamic testing
- **ACTH stimulation test (Cosyntropin test)**: Administer cosyntropin 250 mcg IV/IM; measure cortisol at 0 and 30-60 minutes. Peak cortisol <18 mcg/dL confirms adrenal insufficiency
- **ACTH level**: Elevated in primary AI, low or inappropriately normal in secondary/tertiary AI
- **Renin and aldosterone**: Elevated renin with low aldosterone in primary AI

## Recognition of Adrenal Crisis

### Clinical Presentation
- **Hypotension/shock** refractory to IV fluids and vasopressors (hallmark)
- Severe fatigue, weakness, altered mental status
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (may mimic acute abdomen)
- Fever (may be from crisis itself or underlying infection)
- Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (primary AI), hypoglycemia
- Hypercalcemia (rare but described)

### Common Precipitants
- Acute infection or illness (most common trigger)
- Surgery, trauma, or significant physiologic stress
- Abrupt discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoids
- Adrenal hemorrhage (anticoagulation, sepsis, coagulopathy)
- Missed replacement doses

## Hydrocortisone Protocol for Adrenal Crisis

### Emergency Treatment (Do Not Delay for Diagnostic Testing)
1. **Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus** immediately
2. **IV normal saline** with dextrose: Bolus 1-2 liters rapidly, then continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
3. **Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6-8 hours** for the first 24 hours (total 200 mg/day)
4. Once hemodynamically stable: Taper by 50% per day until reaching physiologic replacement
5. **Physiologic replacement**: Hydrocortisone 15-25 mg/day in divided doses (typically 10-15 mg morning, 5-10 mg afternoon)
6. **Fludrocortisone** (primary AI only): 0.05-0.2 mg daily for mineralocorticoid replacement; not needed during crisis (hydrocortisone at stress doses provides adequate mineralocorticoid activity)
7. Monitor electrolytes, glucose, and hemodynamics closely

### Key Principles
- Treat empirically if clinical suspicion is high; draw cortisol and ACTH before treatment if possible, but DO NOT delay hydrocortisone
- Vasopressor-dependent hypotension unresponsive to fluids should always prompt consideration of adrenal crisis
- Dexamethasone 4 mg IV can be used instead of hydrocortisone if cosyntropin test is planned (does not interfere with cortisol assay)

## Stress Dosing Guidelines

### Sick Day Rules for Patients on Chronic Replacement
- **Minor illness** (cold, mild gastroenteritis): Double oral hydrocortisone dose for 2-3 days
- **Moderate illness** (fever >38C, flu with vomiting): Triple oral dose; consider IM hydrocortisone if unable to take oral
- **Severe illness/major stress** (surgery, trauma, sepsis, critical illness): Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus then 50 mg IV every 6-8 hours
- **Vomiting/unable to take oral medications**: IM hydrocortisone 100 mg; present to emergency department immediately

### Surgical Stress Dosing

| Procedure | Hydrocortisone Dose |
|---|---|
| Minor (dental, local anesthesia) | Take usual morning dose; no additional needed |
| Moderate (orthopedic, abdominal) | 50 mg IV before induction, then 25 mg IV q8h for 24-48 hours |
| Major (cardiac, major abdominal) | 100 mg IV before induction, then 50 mg IV q8h for 48-72 hours |
| Critical illness / septic shock | 50 mg IV q6h (200 mg/day) continuous until stable |

## Patient Education and Safety Measures

### Medical Alert
- All patients with adrenal insufficiency MUST wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace
- Carry an emergency card detailing diagnosis, medication doses, and emergency instructions

### Emergency Injection Kit
- Patients should carry and be trained to self-administer IM hydrocortisone 100 mg
- Family members and close contacts should also be trained
- Kit contents: Hydrocortisone sodium succinate 100 mg vial, syringe, needle, instructions
- Replace kit before expiration date

### Follow-Up
- Endocrinology follow-up every 6-12 months
- Monitor for over- or under-replacement (weight gain, hyperglycemia vs. fatigue, hypotension)
- Annual screening for associated autoimmune conditions in primary AI (thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease)
