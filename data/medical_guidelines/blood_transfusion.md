# Blood Product Transfusion Guidelines

## Packed Red Blood Cells (pRBCs)

### Restrictive vs. Liberal Transfusion Strategy
- **Restrictive strategy (Hb <7 g/dL)**: Recommended for most hemodynamically stable hospitalized patients (TRICC, TRISS, FOCUS trials)
- **Liberal strategy (Hb <8 g/dL)**: Consider for acute coronary syndrome, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, and postoperative cardiac surgery patients
- **Hb <8 g/dL**: Also reasonable threshold for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease or symptoms attributable to anemia (dyspnea, tachycardia, chest pain, presyncope)

### Special Situations
- **Active hemorrhage/hemorrhagic shock**: Transfuse based on clinical status, not specific Hb threshold; activate massive transfusion protocol if indicated
- **Chronic anemia**: Patients often well-compensated at very low Hb; transfuse for symptoms rather than number
- **Sickle cell disease**: Maintain Hb 10 g/dL for acute chest syndrome and stroke; simple transfusion or exchange transfusion depending on clinical scenario
- **Pre-operative**: Optimize Hb; transfuse to >7-8 g/dL before surgery based on patient comorbidities and expected blood loss

### Administration
- Each unit of pRBCs raises Hb approximately 1 g/dL and Hct by 3%
- Infuse over 1-2 hours per unit (maximum 4 hours); slower rate for patients at risk of volume overload
- Single-unit transfusion strategy: Transfuse one unit, reassess clinically, and recheck Hb before ordering additional units

## Platelet Transfusion

### Indications and Thresholds

| Clinical Scenario | Platelet Threshold |
|---|---|
| Prophylactic (stable, non-bleeding) | <10,000/mcL |
| Active non-surgical bleeding | <50,000/mcL |
| Major surgery or invasive procedure | <50,000/mcL |
| Neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery | <100,000/mcL |
| Lumbar puncture | <50,000/mcL (some guidelines suggest <40,000) |
| Epidural placement | <80,000/mcL |
| Massive transfusion | <50,000/mcL |

### Special Considerations
- **Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)**: Transfuse only for life-threatening bleeding; platelets are rapidly consumed
- **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: Platelet transfusion is relatively CONTRAINDICATED (may worsen thrombosis); treat with plasma exchange
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Avoid platelet transfusion unless life-threatening bleeding
- Each apheresis unit raises platelet count by approximately 30,000-50,000/mcL
- Refractory to transfusion: Consider HLA-matched platelets for patients with HLA antibodies

## Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)

### Indications
- Active bleeding with INR >1.5-2.0
- Reversal of warfarin in urgent/emergent situations when 4-factor PCC unavailable
- DIC with active bleeding
- Massive transfusion protocol
- TTP (plasma exchange with FFP replacement)
- Liver disease with coagulopathy and active bleeding or prior to invasive procedure

### Dosing
- 10-15 mL/kg (typical: 3-4 units for average adult)
- Reassess INR after transfusion to guide additional dosing
- Must be ABO-compatible

## Cryoprecipitate

### Contents
- Concentrated source of fibrinogen, factor VIII, factor XIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin

### Indications
- **Fibrinogen <100-150 mg/dL** with active bleeding or DIC
- Massive transfusion with hypofibrinogenemia
- Uremic bleeding (DDAVP preferred first-line)
- Factor XIII deficiency

### Dosing
- 1 pooled unit (5 individual donor units) raises fibrinogen by approximately 50-75 mg/dL
- Goal fibrinogen: >150-200 mg/dL in active bleeding

## Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)

### Definition
- Transfusion of >= 10 units pRBCs within 24 hours, OR >= 4 units in 1 hour with anticipated ongoing need

### Protocol (1:1:1 Ratio)
- 6 units pRBCs : 6 units FFP : 1 apheresis platelet (or 6 pooled platelet concentrates)
- Based on PROPPR trial showing improved hemostasis with balanced resuscitation
- Supplement with cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <150 mg/dL
- **Tranexamic acid (TXA)**: 1g IV over 10 minutes followed by 1g over 8 hours (administer within 3 hours of injury per CRASH-2 trial)

### Monitoring During MTP
- Check CBC, INR, PTT, fibrinogen, ionized calcium, ABG/lactate every 30-60 minutes
- Correct hypocalcemia (citrate toxicity): Calcium gluconate 1g IV per 4 units blood products
- Correct hypothermia: Use blood warmers; target temperature >36C
- Monitor for hyperkalemia (stored blood products have elevated potassium)

## Transfusion Reactions

### Acute Reactions

| Reaction | Onset | Signs/Symptoms | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| Febrile non-hemolytic | During or within 4 hours | Fever, rigors, no hemolysis | Stop transfusion, acetaminophen; usually benign; rule out hemolytic reaction |
| Allergic (mild) | During transfusion | Urticaria, pruritus, no hypotension | Pause transfusion, diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV; may resume if symptoms resolve |
| Anaphylactic | Minutes of starting | Hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema | STOP transfusion, epinephrine 0.3-0.5mg IM, IV fluids, airway management |
| Acute hemolytic | Minutes to hours | Fever, flank pain, dark urine, hypotension, DIC | STOP transfusion immediately, aggressive NS resuscitation, send direct Coombs, repeat type and screen, maintain urine output >1 mL/kg/hr |
| TRALI | Within 6 hours | Acute respiratory distress, bilateral infiltrates, hypoxemia, no volume overload | STOP transfusion, supportive care with oxygen and mechanical ventilation if needed; usually resolves in 48-96 hours |
| TACO | During or within 6 hours | Dyspnea, hypertension, pulmonary edema, elevated BNP | STOP transfusion, upright positioning, diuretics (furosemide 20-40mg IV), supplemental oxygen |

### Delayed Reactions
- **Delayed hemolytic**: 2-14 days post-transfusion; positive DAT, falling Hb, jaundice; usually self-limited
- **Transfusion-associated GVHD**: Rare, often fatal; prevented with irradiated blood products in immunocompromised patients
- **Iron overload**: Chronic transfusion patients; monitor ferritin; chelation with deferasirox when ferritin >1000 ng/mL

### Universal Precautions
- Verify patient identity and blood product compatibility at bedside (two-person verification)
- Observe patient for first 15 minutes of transfusion (most severe reactions occur early)
- Document transfusion volume, duration, and any adverse events
