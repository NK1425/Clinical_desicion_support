# Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Management

## DVT Diagnosis
- **Wells Score for DVT**: Active cancer, paralysis/immobilization, bedridden >3 days/surgery within 12 weeks, tenderness along deep veins, entire leg swelling, calf swelling >3cm vs asymptomatic side, pitting edema, collateral veins, previous DVT
- **Low probability** (Wells ≤1): D-dimer → if negative, DVT excluded; if positive, compression ultrasound
- **High probability** (Wells ≥2): Compression ultrasound; if negative but high suspicion, repeat in 5-7 days

## PE Diagnosis
- **Wells Score for PE**: Clinical signs of DVT (3), PE most likely diagnosis (3), HR >100 (1.5), immobilization/surgery within 4 weeks (1.5), previous DVT/PE (1.5), hemoptysis (1), malignancy (1)
- **Low risk** (Wells ≤4): D-dimer (age-adjusted cutoff: age × 10 for >50yo); if negative, PE excluded
- **High risk** (Wells >4): CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)
- **Massive PE**: Hemodynamic instability (SBP <90, shock) — consider systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy

## Anticoagulation Treatment
### First-Line: DOACs (preferred for non-cancer VTE)
- **Apixaban**: 10mg BID × 7 days, then 5mg BID
- **Rivaroxaban**: 15mg BID × 21 days, then 20mg daily
- **Dabigatran/Edoxaban**: Require 5-10 days of parenteral anticoagulation lead-in

### Alternative
- **LMWH** (enoxaparin 1mg/kg BID): Preferred in cancer-associated VTE (or DOAC)
- **Warfarin**: Target INR 2.0-3.0; requires LMWH bridge for ≥5 days and until INR ≥2.0 × 2 consecutive days

## Duration of Anticoagulation
- **Provoked** (surgery, trauma, immobilization): 3 months
- **Unprovoked**: At least 3-6 months, then assess risk-benefit for extended therapy
- **Cancer-associated**: Continue indefinitely while cancer active or on treatment
- **Recurrent VTE**: Indefinite anticoagulation

## Massive PE — Hemodynamic Instability
- **Systemic thrombolysis**: Alteplase 100mg IV over 2 hours (or tenecteplase weight-based)
- **Catheter-directed therapy**: For contraindications to systemic lysis
- **Surgical embolectomy**: Last resort
- **Supportive**: IV fluids (cautious, 500mL bolus), vasopressors, supplemental oxygen

## IVC Filter
- Only if absolute contraindication to anticoagulation with acute proximal DVT or PE
- Retrieve as soon as anticoagulation can resume
