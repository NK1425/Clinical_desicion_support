# Suicide Risk Assessment

## Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

The C-SSRS is a standardized, evidence-based tool for assessing suicidal ideation and behavior.

### Screening Questions
1. **Wish to be dead**: "Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?"
2. **Active suicidal ideation**: "Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?"
3. **Ideation with method**: "Have you been thinking about how you might do this?"
4. **Intent without plan**: "Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?"
5. **Intent with plan**: "Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?"

A "yes" to questions 3-5 warrants immediate psychiatric evaluation.

## Risk Factors

### Static Risk Factors
- Prior suicide attempt (single strongest predictor)
- Family history of suicide
- History of childhood abuse or trauma
- Male sex (higher completion rate)
- Age >65 or 15-24 years
- Chronic medical illness or chronic pain

### Dynamic Risk Factors
- Current psychiatric diagnosis (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline PD)
- Recent psychiatric hospitalization (within 90 days of discharge)
- Active substance use disorder
- Acute psychosocial stressors (job loss, divorce, bereavement, legal problems)
- Access to lethal means (especially firearms)
- Social isolation and hopelessness
- Recent self-harm or increasing ideation intensity

## Protective Factors
- Strong social support and connectedness
- Responsibility to children or family
- Religious or spiritual beliefs against suicide
- Active engagement in mental health treatment
- Problem-solving and coping skills
- Reasons for living (future-oriented thinking)

## Safety Planning (Stanley-Brown Model)

A collaborative, written safety plan should include six steps:

1. **Warning signs**: Identify personal triggers and early warning thoughts/feelings
2. **Internal coping strategies**: Activities the patient can do alone to distract (exercise, music, breathing)
3. **Social contacts for distraction**: Friends or family who can help redirect attention
4. **People to contact during crisis**: Trusted individuals the patient can tell about suicidal feelings
5. **Professional resources**: Therapist, psychiatrist, 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, local crisis services, emergency department
6. **Lethal means restriction**: Steps to reduce access to methods

## Lethal Means Restriction

- **Firearms**: Counsel on temporary removal from home; offer storage with trusted individual, law enforcement, or gun shop. Firearms account for >50% of suicide deaths.
- **Medications**: Limit quantities prescribed; recommend locking up or removing stockpiled medications
- **Other means**: Assess and address access to sharp objects, ligatures, heights, or vehicles

## When to Hospitalize

### Criteria for Inpatient Psychiatric Admission
- Active suicidal ideation with plan and intent
- Recent serious suicide attempt requiring medical treatment
- Inability to contract for safety or cooperate with outpatient plan
- Command auditory hallucinations to harm self
- Severe agitation or psychosis with suicidal ideation
- Lack of adequate outpatient support or follow-up
- Active intoxication with suicidal statements and inability to assess once sober

### Outpatient Management May Be Appropriate When
- Passive ideation without plan or intent
- Strong protective factors and social support
- Patient is cooperative and engaged in safety planning
- Reliable follow-up within 24-72 hours can be arranged
- Lethal means have been secured

## Documentation Requirements
- Document risk assessment findings using structured format
- Record risk level (low, moderate, high, imminent)
- Note clinical rationale for disposition decision
- Document safety plan discussion and means restriction counseling
- Record follow-up plan and communication with outpatient providers
