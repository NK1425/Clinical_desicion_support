# Thyroid Disorders

## Hypothyroidism

### Diagnosis
- **Primary hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH with low free T4
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH (4.5-10 mIU/L) with normal free T4
- Common causes: Hashimoto thyroiditis (most common), post-radioactive iodine, post-thyroidectomy, medications (lithium, amiodarone), iodine deficiency

### Levothyroxine (LT4) Dosing

**Initial Dosing**:
- Young, healthy adults: 1.6 mcg/kg/day (full replacement dose)
- Elderly or coronary artery disease: Start 12.5-25 mcg/day; increase by 12.5-25 mcg every 4-6 weeks
- Severe/prolonged hypothyroidism: Start low and titrate slowly

**Administration**:
- Take on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime 3+ hours after last meal
- Separate from calcium, iron, PPIs, and cholestyramine by at least 4 hours
- Consistent timing improves TSH stability

### TSH Targets
- **General adult population**: 0.5-2.5 mIU/L (lower half of reference range)
- **Elderly (>70 years)**: 1.0-5.0 mIU/L (higher target acceptable; overtreatment increases atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fracture risk)
- **Pregnancy**: Trimester-specific targets; first trimester <2.5 mIU/L, second/third trimester <3.0 mIU/L
- **Thyroid cancer (DTC) suppression therapy**: 0.1-0.5 mIU/L for intermediate risk; <0.1 mIU/L for high risk

### Monitoring
- Recheck TSH 6-8 weeks after dose initiation or adjustment
- Once stable, monitor TSH every 6-12 months
- Dose adjustments may be needed with weight change, pregnancy, aging, or interacting medications

### Subclinical Hypothyroidism
- **TSH >10 mIU/L**: Treat with levothyroxine (high progression rate to overt hypothyroidism)
- **TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L**: Consider treatment if symptomatic, positive TPO antibodies, dyslipidemia, or pregnancy/planning pregnancy
- **Elderly with TSH 4.5-10**: Generally observe without treatment unless symptomatic (TRUST trial showed no benefit)

## Hyperthyroidism

### Diagnosis
- Suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and/or free T3
- Common causes: Graves disease (most common), toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, thyroiditis (subacute, postpartum), exogenous thyroid hormone

### Treatment Options

**Methimazole (MMI)**:
- First-line antithyroid drug for most patients
- Starting dose: 10-30 mg/day depending on severity; maintenance 5-10 mg/day
- Monitor CBC and LFTs at baseline and if symptoms develop
- Adverse effects: Agranulocytosis (0.2-0.5%), hepatotoxicity, rash, arthralgia
- Contraindicated in first trimester of pregnancy (teratogenic)

**Propylthiouracil (PTU)**:
- Reserved for first trimester of pregnancy and thyroid storm
- Dose: 100-200 mg three times daily; maintenance 50-100 mg TID
- Higher hepatotoxicity risk (including liver failure); more frequent dosing
- Preferred in first trimester (lower teratogenic risk than MMI)

**Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Ablation**:
- Definitive treatment for Graves disease and toxic nodular disease
- Contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and moderate-to-severe Graves ophthalmopathy
- Most patients become hypothyroid within 6-12 months and require lifelong LT4
- Discontinue methimazole 3-5 days before RAI

**Thyroidectomy**:
- Indicated for large goiter with compressive symptoms, suspected malignancy, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy, or patient preference
- Risks: Hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

**Beta-Blockers**:
- Propranolol 20-40 mg TID or atenolol 25-50 mg daily for symptomatic relief (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety)
- Use as adjunct until euthyroid state achieved

## Thyroid Storm

### Diagnosis (Burch-Wartofsky Score)
Clinical diagnosis based on: Temperature >38.5C, tachycardia >130, atrial fibrillation, CNS dysfunction (agitation, delirium, seizure, coma), GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice), heart failure. Score >=45: Highly suggestive of thyroid storm.

### Management (Treat Simultaneously)
1. **PTU** 500-1000 mg loading dose, then 250 mg every 4 hours (blocks synthesis AND peripheral conversion)
2. **Iodine solution** (SSKI 5 drops q6h or Lugol solution 10 drops q8h) -- give at least 1 hour AFTER PTU to prevent iodine utilization
3. **Hydrocortisone** 100 mg IV every 8 hours (blocks T4 to T3 conversion, treats relative adrenal insufficiency)
4. **Propranolol** 60-80 mg PO every 4-6 hours (or esmolol IV if unable to take PO)
5. **Cholestyramine** 4g QID (binds thyroid hormone in enterohepatic circulation)
6. **Supportive care**: Cooling measures for hyperthermia (avoid aspirin -- displaces T4 from binding proteins), IV fluids, glucose, ICU monitoring
7. **Plasmapheresis**: Consider for refractory cases

## Subclinical Hyperthyroidism
- TSH <0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4/T3: Consider treatment if age >65, cardiac risk factors, osteoporosis, or postmenopausal
- TSH 0.1-0.4 mIU/L with normal free T4/T3: Generally observe with repeat testing in 3-6 months
