# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) - Comprehensive Management Guideline

## Diagnosis

- Fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- 2-hour plasma glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during 75g OGTT
- HbA1c >= 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
- Random plasma glucose >= 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms

Two abnormal results from the same or separate samples are required for confirmation in asymptomatic patients.

## Glycemic Targets

- **General adult population**: HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol)
- **Younger patients with short disease duration, no cardiovascular disease**: HbA1c < 6.5%
- **Older adults, limited life expectancy, extensive comorbidities**: HbA1c < 8.0%
- **Fasting glucose target**: 80-130 mg/dL
- **Postprandial glucose target (1-2 hours after meal)**: < 180 mg/dL

## First-Line Pharmacotherapy

**Metformin** remains the preferred initial agent in combination with lifestyle modification.

- Starting dose: 500 mg once or twice daily with meals
- Titrate over 1-2 weeks to target dose of 1000 mg twice daily
- Maximum dose: 2550 mg/day
- Contraindicated when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2; dose reduction when eGFR 30-45
- Monitor vitamin B12 levels annually with long-term use
- Hold before and 48 hours after iodinated contrast procedures if eGFR < 60

## Second-Line Agents (Add to Metformin When HbA1c Not at Target)

**Patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk:**
- GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven CV benefit (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide)
- SGLT2 inhibitors with proven CV benefit (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin)

**Patients with heart failure (especially HFrEF):**
- SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) - Class I recommendation

**Patients with CKD (eGFR 20-60 or albuminuria):**
- SGLT2 inhibitors for renal protection (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin)
- GLP-1 RA as alternative or adjunct

**When weight loss is a priority:**
- GLP-1 receptor agonists (especially semaglutide) or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA (tirzepatide)
- SGLT2 inhibitors

**When cost is a major barrier:**
- Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glipizide) - use with hypoglycemia counseling
- Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone) - avoid in heart failure

## Lifestyle Modifications

- **Medical nutrition therapy**: Individualized meal plan; Mediterranean or DASH dietary patterns recommended
- **Physical activity**: 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; resistance training 2-3 sessions/week
- **Weight management**: Target 5-10% body weight loss for overweight/obese patients
- **Smoking cessation**: Mandatory counseling and pharmacotherapy as needed
- **Alcohol**: Limit to 1 drink/day (women), 2 drinks/day (men)

## Monitoring Schedule

- **HbA1c**: Every 3 months if not at target; every 6 months if stable
- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: Individualized; more frequent if on insulin or sulfonylureas
- **Renal function (eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio)**: Annually
- **Lipid panel**: Annually or 4-12 weeks after initiation/dose change of statin
- **Hepatic function**: At baseline and as clinically indicated

## Complication Screening

- **Retinopathy**: Dilated eye exam at diagnosis, then annually (every 2 years if no retinopathy on 2 consecutive exams)
- **Nephropathy**: Annual eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
- **Neuropathy**: Annual comprehensive foot exam; monofilament testing and vibration assessment
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Annual assessment; initiate statin therapy per risk profile (moderate-intensity for ages 40-75; high-intensity if ASCVD present)
- **Blood pressure**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; ACEi or ARB preferred if albuminuria present

## When to Refer to Endocrinology

- HbA1c persistently > 9% despite dual or triple therapy
- Suspected secondary diabetes or atypical presentation
- Complex insulin regimen management
- Recurrent severe hypoglycemia
