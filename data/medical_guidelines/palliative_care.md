# Palliative Care Principles

## Overview
Palliative care is specialized medical care focused on providing relief from symptoms, pain, and stress of serious illness, regardless of diagnosis or stage. It is appropriate at any point in illness and can be provided alongside curative treatment.

## Symptom Management

### Pain Management
- **WHO Analgesic Ladder**: Step 1 (non-opioid: acetaminophen, NSAIDs) -> Step 2 (mild opioid: tramadol, codeine) -> Step 3 (strong opioid: morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl)
- **Opioid-naive starting doses**: Morphine 5-15 mg PO every 4 hours PRN or 2-5 mg IV every 2-4 hours PRN
- **Titration**: Increase by 25-50% for moderate pain, 50-100% for severe pain
- **Long-acting conversion**: Calculate 24-hour total opioid requirement; convert to extended-release formulation with 10-20% of total daily dose available as breakthrough
- **Adjuvants**: Gabapentin/pregabalin for neuropathic pain, dexamethasone for bone pain and nerve compression, duloxetine for neuropathic pain, ketamine for refractory pain
- **Opioid rotation**: Consider when side effects are intolerable or pain is refractory; use equianalgesic tables with 25-50% dose reduction for cross-tolerance

### Dyspnea Management
- Dyspnea is common in advanced heart failure, COPD, and cancer
- **Opioids**: First-line pharmacologic therapy for refractory dyspnea; morphine 2.5-5 mg PO every 4 hours or 1-2 mg IV every 2-4 hours; opioid-tolerant patients: increase baseline dose by 25%
- **Supplemental oxygen**: Benefit primarily in hypoxemic patients (SpO2 <90%); fan directed at face provides relief regardless of oxygen status
- **Benzodiazepines**: Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg PO/SL/IV every 4-6 hours for anxiety-associated dyspnea; use as adjunct, not first-line
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Positioning (upright, leaning forward), fan therapy, pursed-lip breathing, energy conservation techniques
- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone 4-8 mg daily for lymphangitic carcinomatosis, airway edema, or radiation pneumonitis

### Nausea and Vomiting
Treat based on underlying mechanism:

| Mechanism | Medication | Dose |
|---|---|---|
| Chemoreceptor trigger zone | Ondansetron | 4-8 mg PO/IV every 8 hours |
| | Haloperidol | 0.5-2 mg PO/IV every 6-8 hours |
| | Prochlorperazine | 5-10 mg PO/IV every 6-8 hours |
| Gastroparesis/GI dysmotility | Metoclopramide | 10 mg PO/IV every 6 hours (before meals) |
| Bowel obstruction | Octreotide | 100-300 mcg SC every 8 hours |
| | Dexamethasone | 8-16 mg IV daily |
| Increased ICP/vestibular | Dexamethasone | 4-8 mg IV every 6-8 hours |
| | Meclizine | 25 mg PO every 6 hours |
| Anticipatory | Lorazepam | 0.5-1 mg PO/SL before trigger |
| Multifactorial/refractory | Olanzapine | 2.5-5 mg PO daily |

- **Constipation prevention**: All patients on opioids should receive a bowel regimen (senna 2 tabs BID + docusate 100 mg BID; add polyethylene glycol or lactulose if needed; methylnaltrexone 8-12 mg SC for opioid-induced constipation refractory to laxatives)

## Advance Directives

### Types
- **Living will**: Written document specifying desired treatments in specific clinical scenarios
- **Durable power of attorney for healthcare (healthcare proxy)**: Designates surrogate decision-maker for when patient lacks capacity
- **POLST/MOLST (Physician/Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)**: Actionable medical orders for seriously ill patients reflecting treatment preferences (CPR status, intubation, hospitalization, artificial nutrition)

### Key Components to Address
- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation preferences
- Mechanical ventilation and intubation
- Artificial nutrition and hydration
- Dialysis
- Hospitalization and ICU transfer
- Antibiotic use for life-threatening infections
- Blood transfusion

## Goals of Care Conversations

### SPIKES Framework for Serious Illness Communication
1. **Setting**: Private space, sit down, adequate time, invite key family members
2. **Perception**: Assess patient's understanding of their illness ("What have your doctors told you about your condition?")
3. **Invitation**: Ask permission to share information ("Would it be okay if I share what I'm seeing?")
4. **Knowledge**: Deliver information in clear, compassionate language; avoid jargon; use "warning shot" ("I wish I had better news...")
5. **Emotions**: Respond to emotion with empathy before providing more information (NURSE: Name, Understand, Respect, Support, Explore)
6. **Strategy/Summary**: Develop plan aligned with patient values; summarize decisions; document

### Key Questions for Eliciting Values
- "What is most important to you as you think about your care?"
- "What are you hoping for? What are you worried about?"
- "If time is short, what matters most to you?"
- "Are there things that would be worse than death for you?"

## Hospice Criteria

### General Eligibility
- Prognosis of 6 months or less if disease follows expected course
- Patient elects comfort-focused care
- Two physician certifications required

### Disease-Specific Criteria

**Heart Failure**: NYHA Class IV despite optimal therapy, EF <20%, refractory symptoms, recurrent hospitalizations, cardiac cachexia

**COPD**: Disabling dyspnea at rest, FEV1 <30% predicted, oxygen-dependent, recurrent hospitalizations/exacerbations, cor pulmonale, unintentional weight loss >10%

**Dementia**: FAST Stage 7 or beyond (unable to ambulate, dress, bathe independently; limited speech <6 words; urinary and fecal incontinence), plus comorbid conditions (aspiration pneumonia, pyelonephritis, decubitus ulcers, recurrent fever)

**Cancer**: Metastatic or locally advanced disease; declining functional status (PPS <50%); not a candidate for or declining further disease-directed therapy; weight loss >10% in 6 months

### Hospice Services Include
- Nursing visits, aide services, social work, chaplaincy
- Medications related to terminal diagnosis
- Durable medical equipment (hospital bed, wheelchair, oxygen)
- 24/7 on-call nursing support
- Bereavement support for family for 13 months after death
- Inpatient hospice for acute symptom management (respite and crisis care)
