# Cancer Screening Guidelines

## Breast Cancer Screening

### Mammography (USPSTF 2024)
- **Age 40-49**: Biennial screening mammography recommended (B recommendation)
- **Age 50-74**: Biennial screening mammography (B recommendation)
- **Age 75+**: Insufficient evidence; individualize based on life expectancy and comorbidities
- **High-risk patients** (BRCA carriers, prior chest radiation, >20% lifetime risk): Annual mammography starting at age 30 plus breast MRI

### Supplemental Screening
- Women with dense breasts (BI-RADS C or D) may benefit from breast ultrasound or MRI
- Risk assessment tools: Tyrer-Cuzick model preferred for determining high-risk status

## Cervical Cancer Screening

### Recommended Approaches
- **Age 21-29**: Cervical cytology (Pap smear) alone every 3 years
- **Age 30-65**: Three acceptable strategies:
  - HPV primary testing alone every 5 years (preferred)
  - Co-testing (Pap + HPV) every 5 years
  - Cytology alone every 3 years
- **Age >65**: Discontinue screening if adequate prior negative results (three consecutive negative cytologies or two negative co-tests within 10 years, with most recent within 5 years)
- **Post-hysterectomy**: No screening needed if cervix removed for benign indication and no history of CIN2+

### Special Populations
- HIV-positive women: Screen at diagnosis, repeat at 12 months, then every 3 years if normal
- Immunosuppressed patients: More frequent screening per specialist guidance

## Colorectal Cancer Screening

### Average Risk (Age 45-75)
- **Colonoscopy**: Every 10 years (gold standard)
- **FIT (fecal immunochemical test)**: Annually
- **FIT-DNA (Cologuard)**: Every 1-3 years
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: Every 5 years (or every 10 years if combined with annual FIT)
- **CT colonography**: Every 5 years

### Age Considerations
- **Age 45-49**: Screening recommended (updated from prior age 50 start)
- **Age 76-85**: Individualize decision based on health status, prior screening history, and patient preference
- **Age >85**: Do not screen

### High-Risk Patients
- Family history of CRC in first-degree relative <60 years: Colonoscopy starting at age 40 or 10 years before youngest affected relative, every 5 years
- Lynch syndrome: Colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting at age 20-25
- Inflammatory bowel disease: Colonoscopy with biopsies 8-10 years after diagnosis, then every 1-3 years

## Lung Cancer Screening

### Low-Dose CT (LDCT) Criteria (USPSTF)
- Age 50-80 years
- 20 pack-year smoking history AND currently smoking or quit within past 15 years
- Annual LDCT screening
- Discontinue when patient has not smoked for 15 years or develops a condition substantially limiting life expectancy

### Lung-RADS Reporting
- Category 1-2: Benign or probably benign; continue annual screening
- Category 3: Probably benign; 6-month follow-up LDCT
- Category 4A/4B: Suspicious; short-interval follow-up or tissue sampling

## Prostate Cancer Screening

### PSA-Based Screening (Shared Decision Making)
- **Age 55-69**: Offer shared decision-making conversation about PSA screening; discuss potential benefits (small mortality reduction) and harms (false positives, overdiagnosis, overtreatment)
- **Age 40-54 with high risk**: Consider earlier discussion for African American men and those with first-degree relative with prostate cancer
- **Age >70**: Do not routinely screen
- If PSA elevated (>4.0 ng/mL or age-adjusted threshold), consider repeat PSA, free PSA ratio, or MRI before biopsy
