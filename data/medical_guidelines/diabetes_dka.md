# Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - Emergency Management Guideline

## Definition and Diagnosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by the triad of hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketosis.

### Diagnostic Criteria

| Parameter | Mild DKA | Moderate DKA | Severe DKA |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Blood glucose | > 250 mg/dL | > 250 mg/dL | > 250 mg/dL |
| Arterial pH | 7.25-7.30 | 7.00-7.24 | < 7.00 |
| Serum bicarbonate | 15-18 mEq/L | 10-14.9 mEq/L | < 10 mEq/L |
| Anion gap | > 10 | > 12 | > 12 |
| Serum ketones | Positive | Positive | Positive |
| Mental status | Alert | Alert/drowsy | Stupor/coma |

**Note**: Euglycemic DKA (glucose < 250 mg/dL) may occur with SGLT2 inhibitor use, pregnancy, or reduced oral intake. Maintain high clinical suspicion.

## Common Precipitants

- Infection (most common cause, 30-40% of cases)
- Non-adherence with insulin therapy
- New-onset type 1 diabetes
- Myocardial infarction, stroke, or acute illness
- Medications (corticosteroids, SGLT2 inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics)
- Substance use (cocaine, alcohol)

## Initial Assessment

- **ABCs**: Secure airway if altered mental status; intubate if GCS < 8
- **Labs**: BMP (glucose, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine), venous or arterial blood gas, serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate preferred), CBC, urinalysis, blood cultures if infection suspected
- **Calculate**: Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3); corrected sodium = measured Na + 1.6 x ((glucose - 100) / 100); effective osmolality
- **ECG**: Assess for hyperkalemia/hypokalemia changes, ischemia
- **Identify precipitant**: Chest X-ray, urine culture, lipase as indicated

## Fluid Resuscitation

### Initial Resuscitation
- **0.9% NaCl**: 1-1.5 L/hour for the first 1-2 hours (15-20 mL/kg/hour)
- Assess corrected sodium after initial bolus

### Subsequent Fluids
- **If corrected Na is normal or elevated**: Switch to 0.45% NaCl at 250-500 mL/hour
- **If corrected Na is low**: Continue 0.9% NaCl at 250-500 mL/hour
- **When glucose reaches 200-250 mg/dL**: Add dextrose (D5W with 0.45% NaCl) to allow continued insulin infusion while avoiding hypoglycemia
- Typical fluid deficit: 5-7 liters; replace over 24-48 hours

## Insulin Protocol

### Continuous IV Insulin Infusion (Preferred for Moderate-Severe DKA)
- **Bolus**: Regular insulin 0.1 units/kg IV push (optional per protocol)
- **Infusion**: Regular insulin 0.1 units/kg/hour (or 0.14 units/kg/hour if no bolus)
- **Target glucose decline**: 50-75 mg/dL per hour
- If glucose does not decrease by 10% in the first hour, give 0.14 units/kg IV bolus and reassess
- **When glucose reaches 200-250 mg/dL**: Reduce insulin infusion to 0.02-0.05 units/kg/hour; add dextrose to IV fluids
- Maintain glucose 150-200 mg/dL until DKA resolves

### Subcutaneous Insulin (Mild DKA Only)
- Rapid-acting insulin 0.2 units/kg SC initially, then 0.1 units/kg every hour
- Or rapid-acting insulin 0.3 units/kg initially, then 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours

**Critical**: Do NOT stop insulin infusion until DKA has resolved. Hyperglycemia resolves before ketoacidosis.

## Potassium Management

Potassium replacement is critical due to total body depletion despite initial serum levels.

- **K+ < 3.3 mEq/L**: Hold insulin; replace potassium aggressively (20-40 mEq/hour IV) until K+ > 3.3 mEq/L
- **K+ 3.3-5.3 mEq/L**: Add 20-30 mEq KCl to each liter of IV fluid; target K+ 4.0-5.0 mEq/L
- **K+ > 5.3 mEq/L**: Do not supplement; recheck every 2 hours
- Monitor serum potassium every 1-2 hours during initial management

## Bicarbonate Therapy

- **Not routinely recommended**
- Consider only if pH < 6.9: 100 mEq NaHCO3 in 400 mL sterile water with 20 mEq KCl over 2 hours
- Repeat ABG 2 hours after infusion; repeat bicarbonate if pH remains < 6.9

## Phosphate Replacement

- Routine replacement not recommended
- Replace if serum phosphate < 1.0 mg/dL or if cardiac dysfunction, respiratory depression, or hemolytic anemia present
- Administer 20-30 mEq potassium phosphate in IV fluids

## Monitoring During Treatment

- **Glucose**: Every 1 hour
- **Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3)**: Every 2-4 hours
- **Venous blood gas**: Every 2-4 hours until pH > 7.3
- **Beta-hydroxybutyrate**: Every 2-4 hours if available
- **Anion gap**: Calculate with each electrolyte panel
- **Fluid balance**: Strict intake/output; Foley catheter if altered mental status
- **Neurologic checks**: Assess for cerebral edema (especially in pediatric patients)

## Resolution Criteria

DKA is considered resolved when ALL of the following are met:
- Blood glucose < 200 mg/dL
- Serum bicarbonate >= 15 mEq/L
- Venous pH > 7.3
- Anion gap <= 12 mEq/L

## Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin

- Administer subcutaneous basal insulin (glargine or detemir) at least 2 hours BEFORE discontinuing IV insulin infusion
- If patient was previously on insulin, resume home regimen (with dose adjustment as needed)
- If newly diagnosed, initiate basal-bolus regimen at 0.5-0.8 units/kg/day
- Ensure patient can tolerate oral intake before transitioning
- Overlap IV and SC insulin for at least 1-2 hours to prevent rebound hyperglycemia/ketosis
