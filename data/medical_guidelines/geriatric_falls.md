# Falls Risk Assessment in Elderly

## Epidemiology
- One in four adults aged >= 65 years falls each year
- Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in adults >= 65
- Approximately 30% of falls result in moderate to severe injury
- Annual healthcare cost exceeds $50 billion in the United States

## Screening
- **All adults >= 65**: Ask annually about falls, difficulty with walking or balance
- **Positive screen**: Assess gait and balance; if abnormal, perform multifactorial risk assessment
- **Single fall without injury**: Assess gait and balance
- **Recurrent falls (>=2 in 12 months) or injurious fall**: Full multifactorial assessment

## Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test

### Procedure
1. Patient sits in a standard armchair
2. On "go," patient stands, walks 3 meters at usual pace, turns, walks back, and sits down
3. Time from standing to seated again

### Interpretation
- **<10 seconds**: Normal mobility; low fall risk
- **10-13.5 seconds**: Mildly impaired; moderate fall risk
- **>13.5 seconds**: Significantly impaired; high fall risk
- **>20 seconds**: Marked impairment; very high fall risk; may need assistive device

### Additional Balance Assessments
- **Berg Balance Scale**: 14-item assessment scored 0-56; score <45 predicts fall risk
- **30-Second Chair Stand Test**: Measures lower extremity strength
- **4-Stage Balance Test**: Assesses static balance (feet together, semi-tandem, tandem, single-leg)

## Risk Factors

### Intrinsic Factors
- Age >= 80 years
- Female sex
- History of previous falls (strongest predictor)
- Gait and balance impairment
- Lower extremity weakness
- Visual impairment (acuity, depth perception, contrast sensitivity)
- Cognitive impairment and dementia
- Depression
- Urinary incontinence (urgency leading to rushing)
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Arthritis and foot disorders
- Fear of falling (paradoxically increases risk through activity restriction)

### Extrinsic Factors
- Environmental hazards (loose rugs, poor lighting, clutter, uneven surfaces)
- Inappropriate footwear (slippers, high heels, worn soles)
- Lack of grab bars and handrails
- Psychoactive medications (see medication review)

## Medication Review

### High-Risk Medication Classes
- Benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics (OR 1.4-1.8 for falls)
- Opioids
- Antidepressants (SSRIs and TCAs)
- Antihypertensives (especially alpha-blockers, diuretics)
- Anticholinergics
- Antipsychotics
- Anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin)

### Actions
- Reduce or eliminate psychoactive medications when possible
- Review antihypertensives if orthostatic hypotension present
- Check orthostatic vitals (lying, sitting, standing at 1 and 3 minutes)
- Taper gradually; avoid abrupt discontinuation

## Home Safety Assessment

### Recommended Modifications
- **Lighting**: Adequate illumination in all rooms, hallways, and stairways; nightlights in bedroom and bathroom
- **Flooring**: Remove throw rugs or secure with double-sided tape; repair uneven surfaces
- **Bathroom**: Install grab bars near toilet and in shower/tub; use non-slip mats; raised toilet seat
- **Stairs**: Handrails on both sides; contrast strips on edges; remove clutter
- **Kitchen**: Store frequently used items at waist height; use step stools with handrails
- **General**: Remove clutter from walkways; secure electrical cords; ensure adequate space for assistive devices

### Referral
- Occupational therapy home safety evaluation recommended for patients with recurrent falls or high-risk environments

## Exercise Programs

### Evidence-Based Programs
- **Otago Exercise Programme**: Individually prescribed home-based strength and balance exercises; demonstrated 35% reduction in falls
- **Tai Chi**: Improves balance, proprioception, and lower extremity strength; 20-40% fall reduction
- **Group balance and strength training**: Community-based classes 2-3 times per week
- **Stepping On program**: 7-week group-based program combining exercise, home safety, medication review

### Exercise Prescription
- Balance training: >= 3 hours per week (moderate to high challenge level)
- Progressive resistance training: 2-3 sessions per week targeting lower extremities (quadriceps, hip abductors, ankle dorsiflexors)
- Walking programs alone are insufficient for fall prevention but improve overall fitness

## Hip Fracture Prevention

### Osteoporosis Screening
- DEXA scan recommended for all women >= 65 and men >= 70
- Earlier screening if risk factors present (low body weight, smoking, prior fracture, glucocorticoid use)
- FRAX tool to calculate 10-year fracture probability

### Pharmacologic Prevention
- Vitamin D supplementation: 800-1000 IU daily (maintain 25-OH vitamin D >= 30 ng/mL)
- Calcium: 1000-1200 mg daily (preferably dietary)
- Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid) if osteoporosis confirmed
- Denosumab for bisphosphonate-intolerant patients

### Hip Protectors
- External hip protectors may reduce hip fracture risk in nursing home residents
- Adherence is a significant barrier to effectiveness
