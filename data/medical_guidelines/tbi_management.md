# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Management

## Definition
Traumatic brain injury is an alteration in brain function or pathology caused by an external mechanical force. Severity is classified by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation.

## Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

### Eye Opening (E: 1-4)
- 4: Spontaneous
- 3: To voice/command
- 2: To pain
- 1: None

### Verbal Response (V: 1-5)
- 5: Oriented
- 4: Confused
- 3: Inappropriate words
- 2: Incomprehensible sounds
- 1: None

### Motor Response (M: 1-6)
- 6: Obeys commands
- 5: Localizes pain
- 4: Withdrawal (flexion)
- 3: Abnormal flexion (decorticate)
- 2: Extension (decerebrate)
- 1: None

**Total GCS range: 3-15**

## TBI Classification by Severity

### Mild TBI (GCS 13-15)
- Includes concussion
- LOC < 30 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia < 24 hours
- Most patients recover fully; counsel on post-concussive syndrome
- Discharge with reliable observer and head injury return precautions

### Moderate TBI (GCS 9-12)
- LOC 30 minutes to 24 hours, PTA 1-7 days
- ICU admission with frequent neurochecks
- Repeat neuroimaging at 6-8 hours or with clinical change

### Severe TBI (GCS 3-8)
- LOC > 24 hours, PTA > 7 days
- Requires intubation for airway protection (GCS <= 8 = intubate)
- ICU management with ICP monitoring
- Neurosurgical consultation mandatory

## Imaging Indications

### CT Head Without Contrast (First-Line)
Apply the **Canadian CT Head Rule** (for mild TBI, GCS 13-15):
- **High risk (need CT)**: GCS < 15 at 2 hours post-injury, suspected open/depressed skull fracture, signs of basal skull fracture, >= 2 episodes of vomiting, age >= 65
- **Medium risk**: Retrograde amnesia > 30 minutes, dangerous mechanism (pedestrian struck, fall > 3 feet or 5 stairs, ejection from vehicle)

### CT Angiography
- Indicated when cervical spine fracture involves transverse foramen, Le Fort II/III fractures, or focal neurologic deficit suggesting vascular injury

### MRI Brain
- More sensitive for diffuse axonal injury, posterior fossa lesions, and subacute blood products
- Obtain when CT does not explain neurologic deficits

## Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Management

### Indications for ICP Monitoring
- Severe TBI (GCS 3-8) with abnormal CT (hematoma, contusion, edema, compressed cisterns)
- Severe TBI with normal CT **if** age > 40, motor posturing, or SBP < 90 mmHg
- Target ICP < 22 mmHg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) 60-70 mmHg

### Tiered ICP Management

**Tier 1 (Initial Measures)**
- Head of bed elevation 30 degrees, midline head positioning
- Adequate sedation and analgesia (propofol, fentanyl)
- Avoid hyperthermia (target normothermia)
- Avoid hypotension (SBP > 100 mmHg if age 50-69; SBP > 110 if age 15-49 or >= 70)
- Maintain PaCO2 35-40 mmHg (avoid routine hyperventilation)
- CSF drainage via EVD if in place

**Tier 2 (Escalation)**
- Hyperosmolar therapy:
  - Mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg IV bolus (hold if serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/L or osmolar gap > 20)
  - Hypertonic saline (23.4% NaCl 30 mL IV via central line, or 3% NaCl infusion targeting Na 145-155 mEq/L)
- Brief hyperventilation to PaCO2 30-35 mmHg (short-term rescue only)

**Tier 3 (Refractory Elevated ICP)**
- Decompressive craniectomy (DECRA/RESCUEicp trials: reduces ICP, may improve survival but with variable functional outcome)
- Pentobarbital coma: load 5-10 mg/kg IV, infusion 1-4 mg/kg/hr titrated to burst suppression on continuous EEG
- Therapeutic hypothermia (32-35C) is controversial; not routinely recommended per BTF guidelines

## Seizure Prophylaxis
- **Early post-traumatic seizures** (within 7 days) occur in 10-15% of severe TBI
- Levetiracetam 500-1000 mg IV/PO q12h **or** phenytoin (load 20 mg/kg IV, then 100 mg IV/PO q8h) for **7 days**
- Discontinue at 7 days unless clinical seizures occur (prophylaxis beyond 7 days does not prevent late epilepsy)
- Continuous EEG monitoring recommended in severe TBI patients with unexplained decreased consciousness

## Additional Supportive Care
- Maintain euvolemia; avoid hypotonic fluids (use normal saline as primary crystalloid)
- Glucose control: target 80-180 mg/dL; avoid hypoglycemia
- DVT prophylaxis: pneumatic compression immediately; LMWH at 24-72 hours if hemorrhage stable on repeat imaging
- Nutritional support: initiate enteral feeding within 24-72 hours
- Pituitary dysfunction screening (cortisol, TSH) in moderate-severe TBI
