# Anaphylaxis Management

## Recognition
Anaphylaxis is likely when ANY ONE of the following criteria is met:
1. Acute onset (minutes to hours) with skin/mucosal involvement (urticaria, angioedema, flushing) PLUS respiratory compromise OR hypotension
2. Two or more of the following after exposure to likely allergen: skin/mucosal involvement, respiratory compromise, hypotension, persistent GI symptoms
3. Hypotension after exposure to known allergen (SBP <90 or >30% decrease from baseline)

## Immediate Management
### Epinephrine — FIRST-LINE (do not delay)
- **IM epinephrine 1:1000 (1mg/mL)**: 0.3-0.5mg IM in anterolateral thigh
- Pediatric: 0.01mg/kg (max 0.3mg for <30kg)
- **Repeat every 5-15 minutes** if symptoms persist
- Auto-injectors: EpiPen 0.3mg (>30kg) or EpiPen Jr 0.15mg (<30kg)
- If refractory: Consider IV epinephrine infusion (1-10 mcg/min) in monitored setting

### Positioning
- Supine with legs elevated (if tolerated)
- Sitting upright if respiratory distress
- Do NOT sit or stand patient upright suddenly (risk of cardiovascular collapse)

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **IV fluids**: 1-2L normal saline bolus (20 mL/kg in children); may need large volumes
- **Supplemental oxygen**: High-flow, target SpO2 >94%
- **Albuterol** nebulized: For bronchospasm not responsive to epinephrine
- **H1 antihistamine**: Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV/IM (symptom relief, NOT first-line)
- **H2 antihistamine**: Famotidine 20mg IV (adjunctive)
- **Corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone 125mg IV or dexamethasone 10mg IV — may help prevent biphasic reaction (limited evidence)
- **Glucagon**: 1-5mg IV for patients on beta-blockers with refractory hypotension

## Biphasic Reactions
- Occur in 5-20% of cases, typically within 8-12 hours (up to 72 hours)
- Risk factors: Severe initial presentation, delayed epinephrine administration, wide trigger
- **Observation period**: Minimum 4-6 hours after symptom resolution; 12-24 hours for severe reactions

## Discharge Planning
- Prescribe epinephrine auto-injector (2 doses)
- Written anaphylaxis action plan
- Allergy/immunology referral for trigger identification and desensitization
- Medical alert identification
- Educate: Avoid known triggers, early epinephrine use, seek emergency care even if symptoms resolve

## Common Triggers
- Foods: Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, wheat, soy
- Medications: Penicillins, cephalosporins, NSAIDs, neuromuscular blocking agents
- Insect stings: Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, hornets, fire ants)
- Latex, exercise, idiopathic
