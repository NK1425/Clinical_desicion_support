# Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) — EF ≥50%

## Diagnosis
- Signs/symptoms of heart failure with LVEF ≥50%
- Elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP ≥35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/mL)
- Evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography (elevated E/e', LA enlargement, elevated PASP)
- H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scores aid in diagnosis

## Pharmacotherapy
### SGLT2 Inhibitors (Class I Recommendation)
- **Empagliflozin** 10mg daily or **Dapagliflozin** 10mg daily
- Demonstrated reduction in HF hospitalizations regardless of diabetes status
- First drug class with strong evidence for HFpEF

### Diuretics
- Loop diuretics for congestion management
- Titrate to relieve symptoms; avoid excessive diuresis
- Monitor renal function and electrolytes

### RAAS Inhibitors
- ARBs (candesartan) and ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) may provide modest benefit
- Consider in patients with lower EF range (41-49% — HFmrEF)

### MRA
- Spironolactone may reduce hospitalizations in selected patients
- Monitor potassium closely, especially with renal insufficiency

## Treat Underlying Conditions
- **Hypertension**: Aggressive BP control is critical; target <130/80
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Rate or rhythm control
- **Obesity**: Weight loss improves symptoms and exercise capacity
- **Coronary artery disease**: Revascularization if ischemia contributes
- **Diabetes**: SGLT2 inhibitors preferred

## Non-Pharmacologic Management
- **Exercise training**: Supervised cardiac rehabilitation improves functional capacity and quality of life
- **Sodium restriction**: <2g/day
- **Volume management**: Daily weights, fluid restriction if hyponatremic

## Monitoring
- Symptom assessment with NYHA class and KCCQ questionnaire
- Echocardiography to monitor filling pressures and LVEF
- Regular assessment of renal function and electrolytes
