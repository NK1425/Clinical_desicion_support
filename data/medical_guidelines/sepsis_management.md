# Sepsis and Septic Shock Management

## Definitions (Sepsis-3 Criteria, 2016)
- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, defined as an acute increase of >= 2 points in the SOFA score attributable to infection
- **Septic shock**: Subset of sepsis with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP >= 65 mmHg **and** serum lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation

## Quick SOFA (qSOFA) Screening
Assess at the bedside without laboratory tests. Assign 1 point each:
- Respiratory rate >= 22 breaths/min
- Altered mental status (GCS < 15)
- Systolic blood pressure <= 100 mmHg

**qSOFA >= 2**: Prompts further evaluation for organ dysfunction; not a diagnostic criterion for sepsis but identifies patients at higher risk of poor outcomes. Full SOFA scoring should follow.

## SOFA Score Components
Assess 6 organ systems (0-4 points each, total 0-24):
- **Respiration**: PaO2/FiO2 ratio
- **Coagulation**: Platelet count
- **Liver**: Bilirubin
- **Cardiovascular**: MAP and vasopressor requirement
- **CNS**: Glasgow Coma Scale
- **Renal**: Creatinine and urine output

## Hour-1 Bundle (Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021)
Initiate **all** elements within the first hour of sepsis recognition:

### 1. Measure Lactate
- If lactate > 2 mmol/L, remeasure within 2-4 hours to guide resuscitation
- Target lactate normalization (< 2 mmol/L) or decrease by >= 20% every 2 hours

### 2. Obtain Blood Cultures
- Draw at least **2 sets** (aerobic + anaerobic) from separate venipuncture sites **before** antibiotics
- Additional cultures from indwelling lines if present > 48 hours
- Do **not** delay antibiotics for cultures if there is difficulty obtaining them

### 3. Administer Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics
- Administer within **1 hour** of sepsis recognition (each hour of delay increases mortality by ~4%)
- Empiric coverage based on suspected source:
  - **Pulmonary**: Ceftriaxone + azithromycin; if HAP/VAP risk: piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem + vancomycin
  - **Abdominal**: Piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem (anaerobic + gram-negative coverage)
  - **Urinary**: Ceftriaxone; if complicated/resistant risk: piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem
  - **Skin/soft tissue**: Vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam
  - **Unknown source**: Meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam + vancomycin
- Add MRSA coverage (vancomycin or linezolid) if risk factors present
- Add antifungal (micafungin, anidulafungin) if invasive candidiasis suspected (TPN, prior antibiotics, abdominal surgery, Candida colonization)

### 4. Rapid IV Fluid Resuscitation
- **30 mL/kg** of crystalloid (lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline) within the first 3 hours for hypotension or lactate >= 4 mmol/L
- Reassess volume status after each bolus (clinical exam, passive leg raise, point-of-care ultrasound IVC assessment, pulse pressure variation)
- Avoid excessive fluid administration beyond initial resuscitation; excessive fluids worsen outcomes

### 5. Vasopressors for Refractory Hypotension
- Initiate if MAP remains < 65 mmHg during or after fluid resuscitation
- Do not delay vasopressors while completing fluid boluses

## Vasopressor Selection

### First-Line
- **Norepinephrine** 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min via central line (peripheral OK temporarily for short duration)
- Target MAP >= 65 mmHg (higher targets 75-80 for chronic hypertension not clearly beneficial)

### Second-Line (Add to Norepinephrine)
- **Vasopressin** 0.03-0.04 units/min (fixed dose); add when norepinephrine > 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg/min
- Catecholamine-sparing effect; particularly useful in patients with tachyarrhythmias

### Third-Line
- **Epinephrine** 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min if inadequate response to norepinephrine + vasopressin
- **Phenylephrine**: Consider only in pure vasodilatory shock or significant tachyarrhythmias limiting norepinephrine

### Inotropic Support
- **Dobutamine** 2-20 mcg/kg/min if evidence of myocardial dysfunction (low cardiac output despite adequate filling pressures)

## Source Control
- Identify and address within **6-12 hours** when feasible
- Drain abscesses (percutaneous or surgical)
- Debride necrotic tissue (necrotizing fasciitis requires emergent surgical debridement)
- Remove infected devices (central lines, urinary catheters, prosthetic material)
- Operative repair of perforated viscus

## Adjunctive Therapies
- **Corticosteroids**: Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h if shock refractory to adequate fluids and vasopressors (norepinephrine >= 0.25 mcg/kg/min for >= 4 hours); taper over 3-7 days
- **Stress ulcer prophylaxis**: PPI or H2 blocker in mechanically ventilated patients
- **Glucose control**: Target 144-180 mg/dL; avoid hypoglycemia
- **VTE prophylaxis**: LMWH preferred unless contraindicated; use pneumatic compression if anticoagulation contraindicated

## Reassessment and De-escalation
- Reassess clinical status, lactate, and hemodynamics at 3 and 6 hours
- Narrow antibiotics based on culture results at 48-72 hours
- Procalcitonin-guided de-escalation: consider stopping antibiotics when procalcitonin < 0.5 ng/mL or decreased by >= 80% from peak
- Typical antibiotic duration: 7-10 days; shorter courses acceptable for urinary source with adequate control
