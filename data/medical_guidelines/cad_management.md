# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - Chronic Management Guideline

## Definition

Coronary artery disease encompasses the spectrum of myocardial ischemia caused by atherosclerotic plaque in the epicardial coronary arteries, ranging from stable angina to acute coronary syndromes. This guideline addresses chronic coronary disease (stable ischemic heart disease).

## Diagnosis of Stable Angina

### Clinical Features
- Substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress
- Typically lasts 3-5 minutes; relieved by rest or sublingual nitroglycerin within 5 minutes
- May radiate to left arm, jaw, neck, back, or epigastrium
- Associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, or nausea
- **Typical angina**: 3/3 features (substernal, provoked by exertion/stress, relieved by rest/NTG)
- **Atypical angina**: 2/3 features
- **Non-cardiac chest pain**: 0-1/3 features

### Diagnostic Testing (Based on Pretest Probability)
- **Low pretest probability (< 15%)**: No further testing; consider alternative diagnoses
- **Intermediate pretest probability (15-85%)**:
  - Exercise ECG stress test (if able to exercise and baseline ECG interpretable)
  - Stress imaging (nuclear perfusion, stress echocardiography, stress CMR) if unable to exercise, abnormal baseline ECG, or intermediate exercise ECG result
  - Coronary CT angiography (CCTA): Preferred in lower-intermediate risk; high negative predictive value
- **High pretest probability (> 85%)**: Consider direct referral for invasive coronary angiography

## Risk Factor Modification

### Lipid Management
- **High-intensity statin therapy** for ALL patients with established CAD:
  - Atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg
  - Target: LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (< 55 mg/dL per ESC for very high risk)
- If LDL not at target on maximally tolerated statin:
  - Add ezetimibe 10 mg (reduces LDL by additional 15-20%)
  - If still not at target: add PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab 140 mg SC q2 weeks or alirocumab 75-150 mg SC q2 weeks)
- Monitor lipid panel 4-12 weeks after initiation or dose change
- Statin-associated muscle symptoms: trial of alternative statin, lower dose, or every-other-day dosing

### Blood Pressure Control
- Target < 130/80 mmHg
- Beta-blocker preferred if concurrent angina; ACEi/ARB if concurrent LV dysfunction, diabetes, or CKD
- See hypertension management guideline

### Glycemic Control
- HbA1c < 7% for most patients with diabetes
- SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit in patients with CAD and T2DM

### Smoking Cessation
- Counsel at every visit; offer pharmacotherapy (varenicline, bupropion, NRT)
- Reduces cardiovascular mortality by 36% within 3-5 years

### Weight and Exercise
- Cardiac rehabilitation referral for all patients with established CAD
- 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; prescribe based on stress test results
- Target BMI < 25 kg/m2; waist circumference < 40 inches (men), < 35 inches (women)

## Antiplatelet Therapy

- **Aspirin 75-100 mg daily**: Lifelong for all patients with established CAD
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Aspirin + clopidogrel 75 mg, prasugrel 10 mg, or ticagrelor 90 mg BID
  - After PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES): minimum 6 months DAPT; 12 months if post-ACS
  - Short-duration DAPT (1-3 months) followed by P2Y12 monotherapy may be considered in high bleeding risk patients
- **In patients who cannot take aspirin**: Clopidogrel 75 mg daily as monotherapy
- **Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID + aspirin** (COMPASS regimen): Consider in stable CAD with high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk

## Anti-Anginal Therapy

### First-Line
- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol succinate 25-200 mg daily, bisoprolol 2.5-10 mg daily, atenolol 25-100 mg daily
  - Target resting heart rate 55-60 bpm
  - Preferred in patients with prior MI (mortality benefit) or HFrEF
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Amlodipine 5-10 mg, diltiazem ER 180-360 mg
  - Use when beta-blockers contraindicated (vasospastic angina, severe reactive airway disease)
  - Non-DHP CCBs provide rate control; avoid with beta-blockers

### Second-Line
- **Long-acting nitrates**: Isosorbide mononitrate ER 30-120 mg daily
  - Provide 10-14 hour nitrate-free interval to prevent tolerance
- **Ranolazine**: 500-1000 mg BID; inhibits late sodium current; no effect on HR or BP
  - Add when symptoms persist on beta-blocker/CCB; particularly useful in diabetes

### Sublingual Nitroglycerin
- 0.4 mg sublingual PRN for acute anginal episodes
- Instruct: sit down, place tablet under tongue; repeat every 5 minutes up to 3 times; call 911 if no relief after first dose
- Replace supply every 6 months

## Revascularization Indications

### Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
- Significant stenosis (> 70% by angiography or FFR <= 0.80) with refractory angina despite optimal medical therapy
- Left main disease > 50% (select cases depending on SYNTAX score)
- Improve quality of life in symptomatic patients

### Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)
- **Preferred over PCI when**:
  - Left main disease with high SYNTAX score (> 32)
  - Three-vessel disease, especially with diabetes or LV dysfunction
  - Two-vessel disease with proximal LAD involvement and diabetes
- **Survival benefit demonstrated in**: Left main stenosis, three-vessel disease with depressed LVEF

### Heart Team Approach
- Complex multivessel or left main disease should be discussed by a multidisciplinary heart team (interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical cardiology)

## Follow-Up

- Clinical assessment every 4-6 months in the first year, then annually if stable
- Annual stress testing NOT recommended in stable, asymptomatic patients
- Reassess if change in symptoms: stress imaging or angiography as indicated
- Influenza vaccination annually; pneumococcal vaccination per guidelines
