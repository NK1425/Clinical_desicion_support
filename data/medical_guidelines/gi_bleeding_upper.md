# Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding

## Definition
- Bleeding originating proximal to the ligament of Treitz
- Presentation: Hematemesis (bloody or coffee-ground emesis), melena, or hematochezia (if massive)
- Common causes: Peptic ulcer disease (35-50%), esophageal/gastric varices (10-20%), Mallory-Weiss tears (5-10%), erosive gastritis/esophagitis, vascular malformations, malignancy

## Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS)

Used for pre-endoscopy risk stratification to identify patients who may not require intervention.

| Parameter | Value | Score |
|---|---|---|
| BUN (mg/dL) | 18.2-22.4 | 2 |
| | 22.4-28.0 | 3 |
| | 28.0-70.0 | 4 |
| | >70.0 | 6 |
| Hemoglobin (men, g/dL) | 12.0-12.9 | 1 |
| | 10.0-11.9 | 3 |
| | <10.0 | 6 |
| Hemoglobin (women, g/dL) | 10.0-11.9 | 1 |
| | <10.0 | 6 |
| Systolic BP (mmHg) | 100-109 | 1 |
| | 90-99 | 2 |
| | <90 | 3 |
| Heart rate >= 100 | | 1 |
| Melena | | 1 |
| Syncope | | 2 |
| Hepatic disease | | 2 |
| Heart failure | | 2 |

**Interpretation**: GBS = 0: Very low risk; may consider outpatient management and elective endoscopy. GBS >= 1: Inpatient management and endoscopy recommended.

## Initial Resuscitation

### Airway and Access
- Consider endotracheal intubation for massive hematemesis, altered mental status, or high aspiration risk
- Two large-bore (18G or larger) peripheral IVs
- Type and crossmatch for minimum 2 units packed red blood cells

### Fluid and Blood Product Resuscitation
- Crystalloid resuscitation with normal saline or lactated Ringer's
- **Transfusion threshold**: Hemoglobin <7 g/dL for most patients (restrictive strategy); <8 g/dL for patients with cardiovascular disease
- **Massive transfusion protocol**: Activate if hemorrhagic shock, ongoing brisk bleeding, or anticipated need for >6 units pRBCs in 24 hours (1:1:1 ratio of pRBC:FFP:platelets)

### Medication Management
- Hold anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents (consider reversal based on severity)
- Correct coagulopathy: FFP for INR >1.5 in active bleeding; platelets if <50,000/mcL
- Avoid nasogastric lavage (no longer recommended for diagnosis or management)

## Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy

### Empiric PPI (Pre-Endoscopy)
- **IV pantoprazole or esomeprazole**: 80 mg IV bolus, then 8 mg/hour continuous infusion for patients with suspected high-risk ulcer bleeding
- Pre-endoscopy PPI does not reduce rebleeding or mortality but may downstage lesions at endoscopy

### Post-Endoscopy PPI
- **High-risk ulcer stigmata** (active bleeding, visible vessel, adherent clot): IV PPI infusion 8 mg/hour for 72 hours, then transition to oral PPI BID for 2 weeks, then daily
- **Low-risk stigmata** (clean base, flat spot): Oral PPI once daily

## Endoscopy Timing

- **Urgent (within 12 hours)**: Hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation, bloody NG aspirate or ongoing hematemesis, high clinical suspicion for variceal bleeding
- **Early (within 24 hours)**: Recommended for all patients hospitalized with upper GI bleeding
- **Elective**: GBS = 0 patients may undergo outpatient endoscopy within 72 hours

## Variceal Bleeding

### Pharmacologic Therapy (Start Before Endoscopy)
- **Octreotide**: 50 mcg IV bolus, then 50 mcg/hour infusion for 3-5 days (reduces splanchnic blood flow)
- **IV antibiotics**: Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 7 days (reduces infection and mortality in cirrhotic patients with GI bleeding)

### Endoscopic Therapy
- **Esophageal varices**: Endoscopic variceal ligation (banding) is first-line
- **Gastric varices**: Cyanoacrylate glue injection or TIPS
- **Balloon tamponade** (Blakemore or Minnesota tube): Temporizing measure only for uncontrolled bleeding as bridge to TIPS or repeat endoscopy (max 24 hours)

### Rescue Therapy
- **TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt)**: For refractory variceal bleeding despite endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy; also consider early TIPS (within 72 hours) for high-risk patients (Child-Pugh C 10-13 or Child-Pugh B with active bleeding at endoscopy)

## Rockall Score (Post-Endoscopy)

Predicts rebleeding and mortality after endoscopy.

| Parameter | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Age | <60 | 60-79 | >=80 | -- |
| Shock | None | Pulse >100, SBP >=100 | SBP <100 | -- |
| Comorbidity | None | -- | CHF, IHD, major | Renal failure, liver failure, metastatic cancer |
| Diagnosis | Mallory-Weiss, no lesion | All other | GI malignancy | -- |
| Stigmata | Clean base | -- | Blood, adherent clot, visible vessel, spurting | -- |

**Score <=2**: Low risk (<5% rebleeding, <1% mortality). **Score >=8**: High risk (>40% mortality).
