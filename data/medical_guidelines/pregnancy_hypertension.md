# Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

## Classification

### Chronic Hypertension
- BP >= 140/90 mmHg diagnosed before 20 weeks gestation or preexisting before pregnancy
- Continue pre-pregnancy antihypertensives; switch from ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors (teratogenic) to pregnancy-safe alternatives
- **Preferred medications**: Labetalol, nifedipine extended-release, methyldopa
- **Treatment threshold**: BP >= 140/90 mmHg (CHAP trial 2022 supports treatment at this threshold to reduce adverse outcomes)
- **Target**: BP <140/90 mmHg

### Gestational Hypertension
- New-onset BP >= 140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks gestation WITHOUT proteinuria or other features of preeclampsia
- Close monitoring required: 25-50% progress to preeclampsia
- Antihypertensive treatment if sustained BP >= 140/90 mmHg
- Delivery recommended at 37+0 weeks if well-controlled; earlier if severe features develop

## Preeclampsia

### Diagnostic Criteria (ACOG)
BP >= 140/90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks gestation, PLUS one or more of:
- **Proteinuria**: >= 300 mg/24-hour urine, protein/creatinine ratio >= 0.3, or dipstick >= 2+
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelets <100,000/mcL
- **Renal insufficiency**: Creatinine >1.1 mg/dL or doubling of baseline
- **Liver involvement**: Transaminases >= 2x upper limit of normal
- **Cerebral symptoms**: New-onset headache unresponsive to medication, visual disturbances (scotomata, blurred vision)
- **Pulmonary edema**

### Preeclampsia with Severe Features
- BP >= 160/110 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart (or once if treated immediately)
- Platelets <100,000/mcL
- Liver transaminases >= 2x normal, severe persistent RUQ or epigastric pain
- Creatinine >1.1 mg/dL or doubling
- Pulmonary edema
- New-onset headache or visual disturbances

### Management of Preeclampsia WITHOUT Severe Features
- Expectant management with close monitoring until 37+0 weeks
- Twice-weekly BP monitoring, weekly labs (CBC, CMP, LDH)
- Fetal surveillance: NST and amniotic fluid index twice weekly
- Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone 12 mg IM x 2 doses, 24 hours apart) if <37 weeks and delivery anticipated
- Delivery at 37+0 weeks

### Management of Preeclampsia WITH Severe Features
- **<34 weeks**: Expectant management may be considered at a tertiary center with ability for daily maternal/fetal surveillance; deliver for uncontrollable BP, worsening labs, eclampsia, placental abruption, or non-reassuring fetal status
- **34+0 to 36+6 weeks**: Delivery recommended after stabilization
- **>= 37 weeks**: Delivery after stabilization

### Acute Blood Pressure Management
Treat BP >= 160/110 mmHg urgently (within 30-60 minutes) to prevent stroke:

**First-Line Options**:
- **Labetalol**: 20 mg IV over 2 minutes; if no response in 10 minutes, give 40 mg IV; then 80 mg IV; maximum 300 mg total
- **Hydralazine**: 5-10 mg IV over 2 minutes; repeat every 20-40 minutes; maximum 30 mg total
- **Nifedipine IR**: 10-20 mg PO; repeat every 20-30 minutes; maximum 50 mg total

**Second-Line**:
- Nicardipine IV infusion 5 mg/hour, titrate by 2.5 mg/hour every 5-15 minutes (max 15 mg/hour)
- If refractory to above, consider sodium nitroprusside (last resort, fetal cyanide toxicity risk)

## Eclampsia

### Definition
New-onset seizures in a patient with preeclampsia (or postpartum), not attributable to other causes.

### Magnesium Sulfate Protocol
**First-line treatment AND prophylaxis for seizures in severe preeclampsia**:

- **Loading dose**: 4-6 g IV over 15-20 minutes
- **Maintenance dose**: 1-2 g/hour continuous IV infusion
- Continue for 24-48 hours postpartum (or after last seizure)

**Monitoring During Magnesium Therapy**:
- Serum magnesium levels every 4-6 hours (therapeutic range: 4.8-8.4 mg/dL)
- Patellar reflexes (loss at ~10 mg/dL)
- Respiratory rate (depression at ~12 mg/dL); maintain >12 breaths/min
- Urine output >= 0.5 mL/kg/hour
- Continuous pulse oximetry

**Magnesium Toxicity Reversal**:
- **Calcium gluconate**: 1 g (10 mL of 10%) IV over 3-5 minutes for respiratory depression or cardiac arrest

**Recurrent Seizures on Magnesium**:
- Additional 2g MgSO4 IV bolus over 5 minutes
- If refractory: Lorazepam 2-4 mg IV or diazepam 5-10 mg IV
- Intubation if airway compromise

### Immediate Seizure Management
- Protect from injury; lateral decubitus position to prevent aspiration
- Secure airway; supplemental oxygen
- Seizures typically self-limited (60-90 seconds)
- DO NOT delay magnesium administration
- Continuous fetal monitoring (fetal bradycardia common during seizure; usually resolves within 10-15 minutes)
- Plan for delivery once mother is stabilized (eclampsia is NOT an indication for immediate cesarean if mother and fetus stable)

## HELLP Syndrome

### Definition
Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets. Variant of severe preeclampsia.

### Diagnostic Criteria (Mississippi Classification)
- **Hemolysis**: LDH >= 600 IU/L, schistocytes on peripheral smear, indirect bilirubin elevated, low haptoglobin
- **Elevated liver enzymes**: AST or ALT >= 70 IU/L (or >= 2x upper limit of normal)
- **Low platelets**: Class 1 (<50,000), Class 2 (50,000-100,000), Class 3 (100,000-150,000)

### Management
- Delivery is definitive treatment; recommended at any gestational age for complete HELLP syndrome
- If <34 weeks: Administer betamethasone for fetal lung maturity; attempt to delay delivery 24-48 hours if maternal condition permits
- Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis
- Aggressive BP management
- Transfuse platelets if <20,000 for vaginal delivery or <50,000 for cesarean delivery
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours may be used for platelet improvement (evidence limited)
- Monitor for complications: DIC, placental abruption, hepatic rupture, acute kidney injury, pulmonary edema

### Postpartum
- Labs typically worsen before improving (nadir 24-48 hours postpartum)
- Continue magnesium for 24-48 hours postpartum
- Monitor labs every 6-12 hours until trending toward normalization
- Most cases resolve within 72 hours to 7 days postpartum
- Long-term: Increased lifetime cardiovascular risk; counsel on annual BP monitoring, lipid screening, and cardiovascular risk reduction
