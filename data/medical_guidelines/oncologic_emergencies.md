# Oncologic Emergencies

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

### Definition and Risk
TLS results from rapid cell destruction releasing intracellular contents: potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, and nucleic acids.

**High-risk malignancies**: Burkitt lymphoma, ALL with WBC >100K, DLBCL with bulky disease, AML with WBC >50K.

### Cairo-Bishop Diagnostic Criteria
Laboratory TLS (2 or more within 3 days before or 7 days after treatment):
- Uric acid >= 8 mg/dL or 25% increase
- Potassium >= 6.0 mEq/L or 25% increase
- Phosphorus >= 4.5 mg/dL or 25% increase
- Calcium <= 7.0 mg/dL or 25% decrease

Clinical TLS: Laboratory TLS plus one or more of: renal failure, seizure, cardiac arrhythmia, or death.

### Management
- **Prevention**: Aggressive IV hydration (2.5-3 L/m2/day), allopurinol 300-600 mg/day started 2-3 days before chemotherapy
- **Rasburicase**: 0.2 mg/kg IV single dose for high-risk patients or established TLS. Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (hemolytic anemia risk). Rapidly lowers uric acid within 4 hours.
- **Hyperkalemia**: Treat per standard protocol (calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, kayexalate, dialysis if refractory)
- **Hyperphosphatemia**: Phosphate binders (sevelamer, aluminum hydroxide); avoid calcium-based binders if calcium-phosphorus product >60
- **Dialysis**: For refractory electrolyte disturbances, volume overload, or severe renal failure

## Malignant Spinal Cord Compression

### Clinical Presentation
- Back pain (>90% of patients), often worse supine and at night
- Neurologic deficits: weakness, sensory level, bowel/bladder dysfunction (late finding)
- Thoracic spine most common location (60-70%)

### Management (Time-Critical)
1. **Dexamethasone**: 10 mg IV bolus immediately upon clinical suspicion, then 4 mg IV/PO every 6 hours
2. **MRI of entire spine**: Obtain urgently (within 24 hours); CT myelography if MRI unavailable
3. **Radiation therapy**: Standard treatment; begin within 24 hours of diagnosis
4. **Surgical decompression**: Consider for single-level compression, radioresistant tumors (renal cell, melanoma), spinal instability, or neurologic deterioration during radiation
5. **Prognosis**: Ambulatory status at diagnosis is strongest predictor of outcome; patients ambulatory at treatment have >80% chance of remaining ambulatory

## Superior Vena Cava Syndrome

### Etiology
Malignant causes (>80%): Lung cancer (especially small cell), lymphoma, mediastinal tumors.

### Management
- **Severity assessment**: Mild (facial/neck swelling) vs. severe (stridor, cerebral edema, hemodynamic compromise)
- **Tissue diagnosis**: Obtain before treatment when possible; do not delay treatment for life-threatening symptoms
- **Treatment**: Radiation for NSCLC; chemotherapy for SCLC and lymphoma; endovascular stenting for severe symptoms or as bridge to definitive therapy
- **Supportive care**: Elevate head of bed, supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone 4 mg IV q6h for airway edema

## Febrile Neutropenia

### Definition
- Temperature >= 38.3C (101F) single reading or >= 38.0C (100.4F) sustained over 1 hour
- ANC <500 cells/mcL or expected to decline to <500 within 48 hours

### Empiric Antibiotic Therapy (Within 60 Minutes)
- **Monotherapy**: Cefepime 2g IV q8h, meropenem 1g IV q8h, or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV q6h
- **Add vancomycin** if: hemodynamic instability, skin/soft tissue infection, pneumonia, suspected catheter-related infection, or known MRSA colonization
- **Antifungal coverage**: Add empirically if persistent fever after 4-7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics (micafungin 100 mg IV daily or liposomal amphotericin B)

### MASCC Risk Index
Score >=21: Low risk; may consider outpatient oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin + amoxicillin-clavulanate) in selected patients with close follow-up.

## Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

### Classification
- Mild: 10.5-12.0 mg/dL (corrected)
- Moderate: 12.1-14.0 mg/dL
- Severe: >14.0 mg/dL

### Management
1. **IV normal saline**: 200-300 mL/hr initially; goal 2-4 L in first 24 hours
2. **Zoledronic acid**: 4 mg IV over 15 minutes (onset 2-4 days, duration 2-4 weeks)
3. **Calcitonin**: 4 IU/kg SC/IM every 12 hours for rapid but temporary effect (tachyphylaxis within 48 hours)
4. **Denosumab**: 120 mg SC for bisphosphonate-refractory cases or renal insufficiency
5. **Dialysis**: For severe, life-threatening hypercalcemia unresponsive to medical therapy
6. **Treat underlying malignancy**: Definitive management requires tumor-directed therapy
