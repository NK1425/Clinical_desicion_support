# Depression Screening and Management

## Screening
- **PHQ-2** (initial screen): "Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by: 1) Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 2) Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?"
- Score ≥3: Proceed to PHQ-9

## PHQ-9 Severity
- **0-4**: Minimal/none
- **5-9**: Mild depression — watchful waiting, supportive counseling
- **10-14**: Moderate — consider pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy
- **15-19**: Moderately severe — pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy recommended
- **20-27**: Severe — pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy, consider psychiatry referral

## Question 9 — Suicidality Screening
- "Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself"
- Any positive response requires further safety assessment (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)
- Document risk assessment, safety plan, and follow-up plan

## First-Line Pharmacotherapy — SSRIs
- **Sertraline** (Zoloft): 50mg daily → max 200mg; good safety profile, evidence in cardiac patients
- **Escitalopram** (Lexapro): 10mg daily → max 20mg; fewest drug interactions
- **Fluoxetine** (Prozac): 20mg daily → max 80mg; long half-life; CYP2D6 inhibitor
- **Paroxetine** (Paxil): 20mg daily → max 50mg; most anticholinergic SSRI; discontinuation syndrome
- **Citalopram** (Celexa): 20mg daily → max 40mg (20mg if >60yo); QT prolongation risk at high doses

## Alternative First-Line
- **SNRIs**: Duloxetine 60mg daily (also for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia); Venlafaxine XR 75-225mg daily (monitor BP)
- **Bupropion** XL 150-300mg daily: No sexual side effects, no weight gain; avoid if seizure risk; good for smoking cessation co-treatment

## SSRI Monitoring and Management
- **Onset**: 2-4 weeks for initial response; 6-8 weeks for full effect
- **Common side effects**: Nausea (transient), sexual dysfunction, weight gain, insomnia or somnolence
- **Serotonin syndrome risk**: Avoid with MAOIs, use caution with tramadol, triptans
- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Taper gradually over 2-4 weeks (especially paroxetine, venlafaxine)
- **Monitoring**: Follow up 1-2 weeks after starting, then 4 weeks, then monthly until stable; repeat PHQ-9

## Treatment-Resistant Depression (inadequate response to ≥2 adequate trials)
- Optimization: Ensure adequate dose and duration (6-8 weeks at therapeutic dose)
- Augmentation: Add lithium, atypical antipsychotic (aripiprazole, quetiapine), or thyroid hormone (T3)
- Switch: To different class (SSRI → SNRI → bupropion)
- **Esketamine** (Spravato): Intranasal, for treatment-resistant depression; REMS program required
- ECT: Gold standard for severe/refractory depression; particularly effective for psychotic features, catatonia
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation): Non-invasive, FDA-approved for treatment-resistant MDD

## Psychotherapy
- **CBT** (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy): Strong evidence, comparable to medication for mild-moderate depression
- **IPT** (Interpersonal Therapy): Focuses on relationship patterns
- **Behavioral Activation**: Especially useful when motivation is severely impaired
- Combination of pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy is more effective than either alone

## Duration of Treatment
- First episode: Continue 6-12 months after remission, then consider tapering
- Recurrent episodes (≥3): Consider indefinite maintenance therapy
- Chronic depression (>2 years): Long-term treatment recommended
