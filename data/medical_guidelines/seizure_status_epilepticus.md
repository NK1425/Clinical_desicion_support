# Status Epilepticus Management

## Definition
- **Status epilepticus (SE)**: Continuous seizure activity lasting >= 5 minutes, or two or more discrete seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them
- **Refractory SE (RSE)**: SE persisting despite adequate doses of an initial benzodiazepine and one second-line antiseizure medication
- **Super-refractory SE (SRSE)**: SE continuing >= 24 hours after onset of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on attempted withdrawal of anesthetics

## Initial Stabilization (Time 0-5 Minutes)
- ABCs: secure airway, administer supplemental oxygen, suction as needed
- Obtain IV access (two large-bore IVs); if IV access fails, proceed with IM or intranasal routes
- Point-of-care glucose: treat hypoglycemia immediately with dextrose 50% (50 mL IV)
- Thiamine 100 mg IV before dextrose if alcohol use disorder or malnutrition suspected
- Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring
- Place patient in lateral decubitus position if not intubated

## First-Line: Benzodiazepines (Time 5-20 Minutes)
Administer immediately upon SE recognition. Goal: terminate seizure within 5 minutes of drug administration.

### IV Access Available
- **Lorazepam** 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg per dose); may repeat once in 5-10 minutes
- **Diazepam** 0.15 mg/kg IV (max 10 mg per dose); may repeat once

### No IV Access
- **Midazolam** 10 mg IM (for weight >= 40 kg) via autoinjector or standard syringe into deltoid or lateral thigh
- **Midazolam** 0.2 mg/kg intranasal (max 10 mg) using mucosal atomization device
- **Diazepam** 0.2 mg/kg rectal (max 20 mg)

**Note**: Midazolam IM is preferred over IV lorazepam in the prehospital setting (RAMPART trial).

## Second-Line: Urgent Control (Time 20-40 Minutes)
Administer if seizures persist after adequate benzodiazepine dosing. Choose **one** of the following:

### Levetiracetam (Keppra)
- **Dose**: 60 mg/kg IV (max 4500 mg) infused over 10-15 minutes
- **Advantages**: No significant drug interactions, no cardiac monitoring required, safe in hepatic impairment, no hypotension
- **Disadvantages**: May be less effective than fosphenytoin/valproate per ESETT trial (trend, not significant)

### Fosphenytoin
- **Dose**: 20 mg PE/kg IV (max rate 150 mg PE/min) infused over 10-15 minutes
- **Advantages**: Long clinical experience; therapeutic drug monitoring available
- **Disadvantages**: Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias (requires cardiac monitoring), contraindicated in second/third-degree heart block; avoid in porphyria
- Monitor ECG continuously during infusion; reduce rate if QTc prolongation or hypotension occurs

### Valproate Sodium
- **Dose**: 40 mg/kg IV (max 3000 mg) infused over 10 minutes
- **Advantages**: Broad-spectrum efficacy, minimal sedation, generally well-tolerated hemodynamically
- **Disadvantages**: Hepatotoxicity risk (avoid in liver disease), pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, teratogenic (avoid in pregnancy), hyperammonemia
- Check ammonia level if altered consciousness persists

**ESETT Trial**: Levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate showed equivalent efficacy as second-line agents (~45-50% success rate each). Choice should be individualized based on comorbidities and contraindications.

## Refractory Status Epilepticus (Time > 40 Minutes)
If seizures persist after first-line and one adequate second-line agent:

### Immediate Actions
- Intubation for airway protection
- Arterial line and central venous access
- Continuous EEG monitoring (mandatory)
- ICU admission

### Anesthetic Infusions (Choose One)
- **Midazolam**: Load 0.2 mg/kg IV bolus, then 0.1-2 mg/kg/hr infusion
- **Propofol**: Load 2 mg/kg IV bolus (may repeat), then 1-5 mg/kg/hr infusion; monitor for propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) with CK, triglycerides, lactate
- **Ketamine**: Load 1-2 mg/kg IV bolus, then 1-5 mg/kg/hr infusion; NMDA antagonist may be additive to GABAergic agents
- **Pentobarbital**: Load 5 mg/kg IV at 50 mg/min, then 1-5 mg/kg/hr; titrate to burst suppression on continuous EEG

### EEG Targets
- Seizure suppression or burst suppression pattern
- Maintain anesthetic for 24-48 hours, then taper over 24 hours
- If seizures recur on taper, resume anesthetic and re-attempt taper after another 24 hours

## Workup for Underlying Etiology
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (sodium, calcium, magnesium, glucose, renal/hepatic function)
- Antiseizure medication levels (if on home medications)
- Toxicology screen (urine drug screen, serum ethanol)
- Lumbar puncture if infection or autoimmune encephalitis suspected (after CT)
- MRI brain with and without contrast (when patient stabilized)
- Autoimmune encephalitis panel (NMDA-R, LGI1, CASPR2 antibodies) if no clear etiology
- Consider paraneoplastic workup in new-onset refractory SE of unknown etiology (NORSE)

## Monitoring and Supportive Care
- Continuous EEG for at least 24-48 hours after clinical seizure cessation (nonconvulsive SE occurs in up to 48% of patients after convulsive SE)
- Serial neurologic assessments
- Temperature management: aggressively treat hyperthermia (goal < 38C)
- Avoid and correct metabolic derangements (hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia)
- Rhabdomyolysis screening: CK, renal function; aggressive IV hydration if elevated
- DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic compression devices
