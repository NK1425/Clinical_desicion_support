# Acute Ischemic Stroke Management

## Overview
Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion causing cerebral ischemia. Rapid evaluation and treatment are critical. Time-sensitive interventions include IV thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy.

## NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic assessment scored 0-42:
- **0**: No stroke symptoms
- **1-4**: Minor stroke
- **5-15**: Moderate stroke
- **16-20**: Moderate to severe stroke
- **21-42**: Severe stroke

### NIHSS Components
Level of consciousness, gaze, visual fields, facial palsy, motor arm (L/R), motor leg (L/R), limb ataxia, sensory, best language, dysarthria, extinction/inattention.

## Acute Assessment (Door-to-Needle Target: < 60 minutes)
- ABCs and vital signs; continuous cardiac monitoring
- Point-of-care glucose (exclude hypoglycemia as stroke mimic)
- Non-contrast CT head: exclude hemorrhage (must precede tPA)
- CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck: identify large vessel occlusion (LVO)
- CT perfusion: assess salvageable penumbra (especially for extended window cases)
- Labs: CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, troponin, type and screen

## IV Thrombolysis (Alteplase / Tenecteplase)

### Alteplase (tPA) - Within 4.5 Hours of Symptom Onset
- **Dose**: 0.9 mg/kg IV (max 90 mg); 10% as bolus over 1 minute, remainder infused over 60 minutes
- **Key Inclusion**: Measurable neurologic deficit, CT without hemorrhage, symptom onset clearly defined
- **Key Exclusions**:
  - Active internal bleeding or known bleeding diathesis
  - Platelet count < 100,000/mcL
  - INR > 1.7 or PT > 15 seconds
  - Therapeutic LMWH within 24 hours
  - Blood glucose < 50 mg/dL
  - Major surgery or serious trauma within 14 days
  - History of intracranial hemorrhage
  - **3-4.5 hour window additional exclusions**: Age > 80, NIHSS > 25, oral anticoagulant use, history of both DM and prior ischemic stroke

### Tenecteplase (Emerging Alternative)
- 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus (max 25 mg); single bolus administration offers logistical advantages
- Noninferior to alteplase, particularly for LVO patients proceeding to thrombectomy

## Endovascular Thrombectomy - Within 24 Hours for LVO
- **Indications**: Confirmed LVO (ICA, M1, proximal M2, basilar artery) on CTA
- **Standard window (0-6 hours)**: NIHSS >= 6, pre-stroke mRS 0-1, ASPECTS >= 6
- **Extended window (6-24 hours)**: Must demonstrate favorable perfusion imaging (mismatch between infarct core and ischemic penumbra per DAWN or DEFUSE-3 criteria)
- Thrombectomy should not delay IV tPA; administer tPA first if eligible, then proceed to angiography suite
- Target reperfusion: TICI 2b/3 (successful reperfusion of >= 50% of affected territory)

## Blood Pressure Management

### Pre-Thrombolysis
- Treat only if BP > 185/110 mmHg (to qualify for tPA)
- Agents: labetalol 10-20 mg IV, nicardipine infusion 5-15 mg/hr, clevidipine

### Post-Thrombolysis (First 24 Hours)
- Maintain BP < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after tPA administration
- Frequent monitoring: q15 min for 2 hours, then q30 min for 6 hours, then q1h

### No Thrombolysis Given
- Permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mmHg unless end-organ damage, aortic dissection, or hypertensive emergency
- Gradually lower BP by 15% in first 24 hours if treatment indicated

## Secondary Prevention
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin 325 mg within 24-48 hours (delay 24 hours if tPA given); dual antiplatelet (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days in minor stroke (NIHSS <= 3) or high-risk TIA
- **Statin therapy**: High-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg) regardless of LDL
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Initiate anticoagulation (typically DOAC) at 4-14 days post-stroke depending on infarct size (1-3-6-12 day rule based on severity)
- **Carotid stenosis**: Carotid endarterectomy or stenting for symptomatic stenosis >= 50% (NASCET criteria)
- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg after acute phase; initiate antihypertensives before discharge
- **Lifestyle**: Smoking cessation, exercise, Mediterranean-style diet, diabetes optimization (HbA1c < 7%)
