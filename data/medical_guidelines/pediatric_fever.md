# Pediatric Fever Management

## Definition
- Fever defined as rectal temperature >= 38.0C (100.4F)
- Rectal temperature is the gold standard in infants <3 months

## Age-Based Approach

### Neonates (0-28 Days) - FULL SEPTIC WORKUP

All febrile neonates require emergent evaluation and empiric treatment.

**Mandatory Workup**:
- Complete blood count with differential
- Blood culture
- Urinalysis and urine culture (catheterized specimen)
- Lumbar puncture with CSF studies (cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture)
- Consider HSV PCR on CSF and surface cultures if risk factors present (maternal HSV, vesicular lesions, seizures, elevated LFTs)
- Chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms present

**Empiric Treatment**:
- **Ampicillin** 50 mg/kg IV q8h (covers Listeria, Group B Streptococcus, Enterococcus)
- **Gentamicin** 4 mg/kg IV q24h OR **Cefotaxime** 50 mg/kg IV q8h (covers gram-negative organisms)
- **Add acyclovir** 20 mg/kg IV q8h if any concern for HSV (vesicles, seizures, CSF pleocytosis, elevated AST/ALT, ill appearance)

**Disposition**: Mandatory hospital admission pending culture results for minimum 48-72 hours.

### Infants 29-60 Days

**Risk Stratification Required**: Use validated criteria to determine need for LP and admission.

**Rochester Criteria (Low Risk)**:
- Previously healthy, term infant
- Non-toxic appearance
- No focal bacterial infection on exam (except otitis media)
- WBC 5,000-15,000/mm3
- Band count <1,500/mm3
- Urinalysis <10 WBC/hpf
- If diarrhea: stool <5 WBC/hpf

**If low-risk by Rochester criteria**: May consider outpatient management with close follow-up in 24 hours, provided blood and urine cultures obtained and empiric IM ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) administered.

**If high-risk or ill-appearing**: Full septic workup including LP, empiric IV antibiotics, and hospital admission.

### Philadelphia Criteria (28-60 Days)
Low-risk classification requires ALL of:
- Well-appearing infant
- No prior antibiotics
- WBC <15,000/mm3
- Band-to-neutrophil ratio <0.2
- UA <10 WBC/hpf
- CSF <8 WBC/mm3 and negative Gram stain
- Normal chest X-ray if obtained

### Infants 60-90 Days
- Urinalysis and urine culture remain mandatory
- Blood culture recommended
- LP based on clinical assessment and inflammatory markers
- Consider procalcitonin (<0.5 ng/mL supports low risk) and CRP as adjunct risk stratification tools
- If well-appearing with negative urinalysis and low inflammatory markers, may manage as outpatient with reliable follow-up

### Children 3-36 Months
- UTI evaluation: Obtain urinalysis/urine culture in all girls <24 months with fever, uncircumcised boys <12 months, circumcised boys <6 months
- Blood work generally not required if well-appearing, immunized, and no focal source
- Fever without source in a fully immunized child rarely requires extensive workup
- Consider occult pneumonia if fever >39C for >48 hours without source; obtain CXR

### Children >36 Months
- Guided by clinical presentation and examination findings
- Most febrile illnesses are viral and self-limited
- Evaluate for specific source: pharyngitis (rapid strep), UTI, pneumonia, skin/soft tissue

## Antipyretic Therapy

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acetaminophen | 15 mg/kg/dose | Every 4-6 hours | Max 75 mg/kg/day; avoid in liver disease |
| Ibuprofen | 10 mg/kg/dose | Every 6-8 hours | Age >= 6 months only; avoid in dehydration, renal disease |

- Alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen is common but increases risk of dosing errors
- Goal is comfort, not normothermia; fever itself is not harmful
- Do NOT use aspirin in children (risk of Reye syndrome)

## When to Admit
- All febrile neonates <28 days
- Ill or toxic appearance at any age
- High-risk infants 29-60 days per stratification criteria
- Signs of meningitis, sepsis, or serious bacterial infection
- Immunocompromised patients with fever
- Inability to maintain adequate oral hydration
- Unreliable follow-up or caregiver concerns
