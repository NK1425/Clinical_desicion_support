# Geriatric Polypharmacy Management

## Definition
- **Polypharmacy**: Use of 5 or more concurrent medications
- **Excessive polypharmacy**: Use of 10 or more concurrent medications
- Prevalence: Approximately 40% of older adults (>65 years) take 5+ medications

## Beers Criteria (AGS 2023 Update)

The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria identifies potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) for older adults.

### Medications to Avoid in Most Older Adults

| Drug Class | Examples | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| First-generation antihistamines | Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine | Highly anticholinergic; confusion, urinary retention, constipation, sedation |
| Benzodiazepines | Diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam | Increased fall risk, cognitive impairment, delirium, fractures |
| Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics | Zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone | Falls, delirium, fractures; minimal improvement in sleep latency |
| Tertiary TCAs | Amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin (>6 mg) | Highly anticholinergic, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac conduction effects |
| Antipsychotics (first and second gen) | Haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine | Increased stroke risk, mortality in dementia; avoid for behavioral symptoms of dementia unless non-pharmacologic measures failed |
| Skeletal muscle relaxants | Cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, carisoprodol | Anticholinergic effects, sedation, questionable efficacy in elderly |
| Proton pump inhibitors (>8 weeks) | Omeprazole, pantoprazole | C. difficile risk, fractures, hypomagnesemia; use lowest dose for shortest duration |
| NSAIDs (chronic use) | Ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam | GI bleeding, renal injury, cardiovascular events, HTN exacerbation |
| Sulfonylureas (long-acting) | Glyburide, chlorpropamide | Higher risk of prolonged hypoglycemia |
| Meperidine | -- | Neurotoxic metabolite accumulation, seizure risk |

## Anticholinergic Burden

### Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) Scale
- Score 1 (possible anticholinergic): Atenolol, metformin, furosemide, warfarin
- Score 2 (definite anticholinergic): Amantadine, carbamazepine, cyclobenzaprine
- Score 3 (definite, high potency): Oxybutynin, tolterodine, amitriptyline, diphenhydramine, paroxetine, olanzapine

**Cumulative ACB score >= 3**: Associated with increased cognitive decline, delirium, falls, hospitalization, and mortality.

### Management of Anticholinergic Burden
- Calculate total ACB score at each medication review
- Prioritize discontinuation or substitution of highest-scoring agents
- Common substitutions: Oxybutynin to mirabegron, amitriptyline to duloxetine or nortriptyline, diphenhydramine to melatonin

## Fall Risk Medications

Medications associated with increased fall risk in elderly:
- **Sedative-hypnotics**: Benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, barbiturates
- **Opioids**: All opioids increase fall and fracture risk
- **Antihypertensives**: Alpha-blockers (doxazosin), centrally-acting agents (clonidine); risk of orthostatic hypotension
- **Diuretics**: Overdiuresis leading to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension
- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs (hyponatremia, serotonin-mediated bone effects), TCAs (orthostasis, sedation)
- **Antipsychotics**: Orthostatic hypotension, sedation, extrapyramidal effects
- **Anticonvulsants**: Gabapentin, pregabalin (dizziness, ataxia)
- **Anticholinergics**: Blurred vision, confusion, dizziness

## Deprescribing Principles

### Systematic Approach
1. **Ascertain**: List all current medications including OTC, supplements, and herbals
2. **Identify**: Flag potentially inappropriate medications using Beers criteria, STOPP/START criteria, and anticholinergic burden tools
3. **Determine**: Assess whether each medication has an ongoing indication
4. **Prioritize**: Rank medications for discontinuation based on harm potential and patient preferences
5. **Plan**: Taper gradually (avoid abrupt discontinuation of beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, corticosteroids, opioids, gabapentinoids)
6. **Monitor**: Follow up within 1-4 weeks for withdrawal symptoms, rebound effects, and clinical status

### Key Deprescribing Resources
- deprescribing.org evidence-based algorithms for PPIs, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antihyperglycemics
- STOPP/START criteria (European-based complementary tool to Beers)
- MedStopper tool for prioritizing medications to discontinue

## Medication Reconciliation

### Best Practices
- Perform at every transition of care (admission, transfer, discharge)
- Use "brown bag" method: Ask patients to bring all medications to appointments
- Verify against pharmacy records, primary care records, and specialist lists
- Engage pharmacist for comprehensive medication therapy management (MTM)
- Document intentional discrepancies with rationale
- Communicate updated medication list to patient, caregivers, and all providers
