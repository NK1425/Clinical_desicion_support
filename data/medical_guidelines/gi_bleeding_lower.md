# Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding

## Definition
- Bleeding originating distal to the ligament of Treitz (small bowel and colon)
- Most commonly colonic in origin
- Presentation: Hematochezia (bright red blood per rectum), maroon stools, or occult blood

## Common Etiologies

| Cause | Frequency | Typical Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| Diverticular bleeding | 30-40% | Painless, acute, large-volume hematochezia |
| Angiodysplasia | 5-20% | Chronic or recurrent, often right-sided |
| Colitis (ischemic, infectious, IBD) | 10-20% | Bloody diarrhea, cramping, fever |
| Hemorrhoids/anal fissures | 5-10% | Bright red blood on toilet paper or coating stool |
| Post-polypectomy bleeding | 5-10% | Delayed bleeding 1-14 days after procedure |
| Colorectal neoplasia | 5-10% | Chronic occult blood loss, iron deficiency anemia |
| Rectal ulcers | 2-5% | Rectal pain, tenesmus |

## Evaluation Algorithm

### Step 1: Initial Assessment and Resuscitation
- Assess hemodynamic stability (heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic changes)
- Two large-bore IV access, type and crossmatch
- Labs: CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, lactate
- Transfuse pRBCs for Hb <7 g/dL (or <8 g/dL with cardiovascular disease)
- Correct coagulopathy if actively bleeding

### Step 2: Exclude Upper GI Source
- Brisk upper GI bleeding can present as hematochezia
- Consider upper endoscopy first if: hemodynamic instability, BUN/creatinine ratio >30, nasogastric aspirate with blood (though routine NG tube placement is not recommended)
- Clinical clues favoring upper source: melena, hematemesis, elevated BUN

### Step 3: Anorectal Examination
- Digital rectal examination and anoscopy to evaluate for hemorrhoids, fissures, rectal masses
- If clear anorectal source identified in stable patient with minor bleeding, no further workup may be needed

### Step 4: Colonoscopy
- **Timing**: Within 24 hours of presentation after adequate bowel preparation (urgent colonoscopy)
- **Bowel preparation**: Rapid prep with 4-6 liters of polyethylene glycol solution over 3-4 hours (via NG tube if unable to drink)
- Colonoscopy identifies bleeding source in 45-90% of cases
- Therapeutic interventions: Epinephrine injection, bipolar cautery, hemoclipping, band ligation

### Step 5: Additional Diagnostic Studies (if colonoscopy non-diagnostic)
- **CT angiography**: Detects bleeding rates >= 0.3-0.5 mL/min; useful when colonoscopy cannot be performed or is non-diagnostic
- **Tagged RBC scan (nuclear scintigraphy)**: Detects bleeding rates >= 0.1-0.4 mL/min; high sensitivity but poor localization; useful to confirm active bleeding before angiography
- **Mesenteric angiography**: Detects bleeding >= 0.5-1.0 mL/min; allows therapeutic embolization; obtain after positive CTA or RBC scan
- **Capsule endoscopy**: For suspected small bowel bleeding after negative upper and lower endoscopy

## Diverticular Bleeding

### Characteristics
- Most common cause of significant lower GI bleeding
- Typically painless, acute-onset, large-volume hematochezia
- 70-80% stops spontaneously
- Right-sided diverticula bleed more frequently despite left-sided prevalence of diverticulosis
- Recurrence rate: 20-30% after first episode, up to 50% after second episode

### Management
- Resuscitation and colonoscopy with hemostasis when source identified
- If recurrent bleeding: consider segmental colectomy after localization
- Avoid NSAIDs and aspirin when possible (increase recurrence risk)

## Angiodysplasia (Arteriovenous Malformations)

### Characteristics
- Degenerative vascular lesions; prevalence increases with age
- Most common in cecum and right colon
- Associated with aortic stenosis (Heyde syndrome), chronic kidney disease, von Willebrand disease
- Typically causes chronic, intermittent, low-volume bleeding; can cause acute hemorrhage

### Management
- Endoscopic treatment: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) preferred, also bipolar cautery or hemoclipping
- Refractory cases: Angiographic embolization or surgical resection
- Medical therapy for recurrent bleeding: Consider octreotide or thalidomide (limited evidence)

## Massive Lower GI Bleeding Management

### Definition
- Hemodynamic instability (SBP <90, HR >100) requiring >= 2 units pRBCs
- Ongoing brisk hematochezia with hemodynamic compromise

### Protocol
1. **Activate massive transfusion protocol** if indicated (1:1:1 pRBC:FFP:platelets)
2. **Resuscitate aggressively**: Target MAP >= 65 mmHg; vasopressors if needed after volume resuscitation
3. **Urgent CT angiography**: First-line imaging in hemodynamically unstable patients to localize bleeding
4. **Interventional radiology**: Mesenteric angiography with embolization if CTA positive
5. **Emergent colonoscopy**: After stabilization and rapid bowel prep if feasible
6. **Surgical consultation**: Early involvement for massive or refractory bleeding
7. **Emergent surgery**: Subtotal colectomy for life-threatening hemorrhage when source cannot be localized; segmental colectomy if source definitively identified

### Outcomes
- Overall mortality for lower GI bleeding: 2-4%
- Massive lower GI bleeding mortality: 10-20%
- 80-85% of lower GI bleeding stops spontaneously
