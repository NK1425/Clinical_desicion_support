# Pain Management

## WHO Analgesic Ladder (Modified)
### Step 1 — Mild Pain (1-3/10)
- **Acetaminophen**: 500-1000mg every 6-8 hours; max 3g/day (2g/day if liver disease or alcohol use)
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen 400-600mg TID, naproxen 250-500mg BID, celecoxib 200mg daily
- NSAID precautions: GI bleeding (use with PPI if risk factors), renal impairment, cardiovascular risk, avoid in CKD Stage 4-5

### Step 2 — Moderate Pain (4-6/10)
- **Tramadol**: 50-100mg every 4-6 hours; max 400mg/day; serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs; seizure risk
- **Combination therapy**: Acetaminophen + NSAID (different mechanisms, additive effect)
- Consider adjuvants for specific pain types

### Step 3 — Severe Pain (7-10/10)
- **Strong opioids**: Morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl
- Start low, titrate slowly; equianalgesic dosing tables for conversions
- Always prescribe laxatives (senna, docusate) with scheduled opioids
- Consider naloxone co-prescription if ≥50 MME/day

## Neuropathic Pain
- **First-line**: Gabapentin (start 300mg/day, titrate to 1800-3600mg/day in divided doses), pregabalin (75-300mg BID)
- **First-line alternative**: Duloxetine (60-120mg daily), venlafaxine (150-225mg daily)
- **Second-line**: TCAs (amitriptyline 25-75mg at bedtime — caution in elderly), topical lidocaine 5% patch
- **Third-line**: Tramadol, tapentadol; combination therapy
- For diabetic neuropathy: Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved

## Multimodal Analgesia
- Combine agents with different mechanisms to improve pain control and reduce opioid requirements
- Regional anesthesia (nerve blocks, epidurals) when appropriate
- Non-pharmacologic: Physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, TENS, acupuncture, heat/cold therapy

## Opioid Prescribing Best Practices
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration
- Check prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) before prescribing
- Avoid concurrent benzodiazepines (FDA black box warning — increased risk of respiratory depression and death)
- Risk assessment: Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), SOAPP-R
- **Tapering**: Reduce by 10-25% every 2-4 weeks; slower for long-term use (>1 year)
- Naloxone: Prescribe if ≥50 MME/day, concurrent benzodiazepines, or history of overdose/substance use

## Opioid Equianalgesic Doses (Approximate, oral)
| Opioid | Equianalgesic Dose |
|--------|-------------------|
| Morphine | 30mg |
| Oxycodone | 20mg |
| Hydromorphone | 6mg |
| Hydrocodone | 30mg |
| Fentanyl patch | 12.5 mcg/hr ≈ 30-44 MME/day |

## Chronic Pain Considerations
- Emphasize function over pain scores
- Set realistic expectations
- Multimodal and multidisciplinary approach
- Regular reassessment of risks and benefits
- Consider interventional procedures for refractory pain
