# Hypertensive Emergencies and Urgencies - Clinical Guideline

## Definitions

### Hypertensive Emergency
- Severe blood pressure elevation (typically SBP > 180 and/or DBP > 120 mmHg) with **acute end-organ damage**
- Requires immediate BP reduction with intravenous agents in an ICU setting
- End-organ damage includes: hypertensive encephalopathy, acute intracranial hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, acute aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure/pulmonary edema, eclampsia, acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

### Hypertensive Urgency
- Severe BP elevation (SBP > 180 and/or DBP > 120 mmHg) **without** evidence of acute end-organ damage
- Can be managed with oral antihypertensives and outpatient follow-up within 24-48 hours
- Avoid rapid BP reduction in urgency (risk of ischemic events)

## Initial Assessment

- **Focused history**: Headache, visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, neurologic deficits, medication non-adherence, substance use (cocaine, amphetamines), pregnancy status
- **Physical exam**: Fundoscopy (papilledema, hemorrhages, exudates), neurologic exam, cardiopulmonary exam, peripheral pulses (aortic dissection screening)
- **Urgent labs**: BMP (creatinine, potassium), CBC with peripheral smear, urinalysis, troponin, BNP/NT-proBNP
- **Imaging**: ECG, chest X-ray; CT head if neurologic symptoms; CT angiography if aortic dissection suspected
- **Urine drug screen**: If substance use suspected

## Blood Pressure Reduction Targets

### General Principle
- Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) by **no more than 25%** in the first hour
- Then reduce to approximately 160/100 mmHg over the next 2-6 hours
- Gradual normalization to target BP over 24-48 hours
- Excessively rapid reduction causes watershed ischemia (stroke, MI, renal failure)

### Condition-Specific Targets

**Aortic Dissection**
- Most aggressive target: SBP < 120 mmHg AND heart rate < 60 bpm within 20 minutes
- IV esmolol (preferred) or labetalol first to reduce heart rate
- Add IV nicardipine or nitroprusside if additional BP reduction needed AFTER rate control
- Beta-blocker BEFORE vasodilator (prevent reflex tachycardia)

**Acute Ischemic Stroke (Eligible for Thrombolysis)**
- Reduce to < 185/110 mmHg before tPA administration
- Maintain < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after tPA
- IV labetalol or nicardipine preferred

**Acute Ischemic Stroke (Not Eligible for Thrombolysis)**
- Treat only if BP > 220/120 mmHg
- Reduce by 15% over 24 hours

**Intracerebral Hemorrhage**
- If SBP 150-220 mmHg: Target SBP < 140 mmHg (INTERACT2/ATACH-2 evidence)
- Rapid reduction (within 1 hour) is acceptable; IV nicardipine or clevidipine preferred

**Acute Pulmonary Edema/Decompensated Heart Failure**
- IV nitroglycerin or nitroprusside (reduce preload and afterload)
- IV loop diuretics concurrently
- Avoid beta-blockers acutely in decompensated HF

**Eclampsia/Severe Preeclampsia**
- IV labetalol, IV hydralazine, or oral nifedipine
- Target SBP < 160 and DBP < 110 mmHg
- Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (4-6g IV load, then 1-2g/hour)

**Acute Coronary Syndrome**
- IV nitroglycerin (preferred)
- IV esmolol or labetalol
- Avoid nitroprusside (coronary steal risk)

**Pheochromocytoma Crisis**
- IV phentolamine (alpha-blocker) first
- Add beta-blocker ONLY after alpha-blockade established (prevent unopposed alpha stimulation)
- Avoid beta-blockers alone

## Intravenous Antihypertensive Agents

### Nicardipine
- Dihydropyridine CCB; continuous infusion
- Starting dose: 5 mg/hour IV; titrate by 2.5 mg/hour every 5-15 minutes; maximum 15 mg/hour
- Predictable, titratable response; preferred in many scenarios
- Avoid in decompensated HF with reduced EF

### Labetalol
- Combined alpha/beta-blocker
- IV push: 20 mg over 2 minutes; repeat 20-80 mg every 10 minutes (max 300 mg total)
- IV infusion: 0.5-2 mg/minute
- Preferred in: aortic dissection (with rate control), eclampsia, acute stroke
- Avoid in: decompensated HF, severe bradycardia, asthma, cocaine toxicity

### Esmolol
- Ultra-short-acting beta-1 selective blocker
- Loading dose: 500 mcg/kg over 1 minute; infusion: 50-200 mcg/kg/minute
- Preferred in aortic dissection (precise rate control)
- Very short half-life (9 minutes); easily titratable

### Nitroglycerin
- Venodilator (reduces preload); coronary vasodilator at higher doses
- Infusion: 5-200 mcg/minute; titrate every 3-5 minutes
- Preferred in ACS and acute pulmonary edema
- Avoid in right ventricular infarction, PDE5 inhibitor use within 24-48 hours

### Nitroprusside
- Arterial and venous dilator; potent and rapid onset
- Infusion: 0.25-10 mcg/kg/minute
- Risk of cyanide toxicity with prolonged use (> 48 hours) or high doses; monitor thiocyanate levels
- Avoid in hepatic/renal insufficiency, pregnancy, and increased ICP

### Clevidipine
- Ultra-short-acting dihydropyridine CCB
- Infusion: 1-2 mg/hour initially; titrate by doubling every 90 seconds; max 32 mg/hour
- Lipid emulsion formulation; avoid in soy/egg allergy, severe lipid disorders

### Hydralazine
- Direct arteriolar vasodilator
- IV push: 5-10 mg every 20-30 minutes
- Unpredictable response; reflex tachycardia
- Primarily used in eclampsia/preeclampsia when labetalol is unavailable

### Phentolamine
- Non-selective alpha-blocker
- IV bolus: 5 mg every 10-15 minutes
- Reserved for catecholamine-excess states (pheochromocytoma, cocaine, MAOi crisis)

## Hypertensive Urgency Management

- Reinstitute or uptitrate oral antihypertensives
- Options: oral captopril 25 mg, oral labetalol 200 mg, oral clonidine 0.1-0.2 mg, oral amlodipine 5-10 mg
- Observe for 2-6 hours to ensure BP trending down
- Avoid sublingual nifedipine (unpredictable precipitous drops)
- Discharge with close follow-up in 24-72 hours; optimize long-term regimen
- Assess and address medication non-adherence
