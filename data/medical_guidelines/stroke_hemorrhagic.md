# Hemorrhagic Stroke (Intracerebral Hemorrhage) Management

## Definition
Spontaneous (non-traumatic) bleeding into the brain parenchyma, often with extension into the ventricular system. Accounts for approximately 10-15% of all strokes with significantly higher mortality than ischemic stroke.

## Common Etiologies
- **Hypertension** (most common; deep structures: basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, cerebellum)
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar hemorrhages in elderly)
- Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy
- Vascular malformations (AVM, cavernous malformation)
- Coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia
- Hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke
- Illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines)
- Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

## ICH Score (Prognostic Tool)
Assign points to estimate 30-day mortality:

| Component | Criteria | Points |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| GCS | 3-4 | 2 |
| GCS | 5-12 | 1 |
| GCS | 13-15 | 0 |
| ICH volume | >= 30 mL | 1 |
| ICH volume | < 30 mL | 0 |
| IVH present | Yes | 1 |
| IVH present | No | 0 |
| Infratentorial origin | Yes | 1 |
| Infratentorial origin | No | 0 |
| Age | >= 80 | 1 |
| Age | < 80 | 0 |

- **Score 0**: ~0% mortality
- **Score 1**: ~13% mortality
- **Score 2**: ~26% mortality
- **Score 3**: ~72% mortality
- **Score 4-5**: ~90-100% mortality

**Note**: The ICH score should not be used in isolation to make withdrawal-of-care decisions; early aggressive care is recommended regardless of initial score.

## Acute Blood Pressure Management
- **Target SBP < 140 mmHg** within 1 hour of presentation (per AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines and INTERACT2/ATACH-2 trials)
- Avoid SBP < 110 mmHg (associated with AKI and worse outcomes)
- **Preferred agents**:
  - Nicardipine infusion: start 5 mg/hr, titrate by 2.5 mg/hr q5-15 min (max 15 mg/hr)
  - Clevidipine infusion: start 1-2 mg/hr, titrate q90 seconds
  - Labetalol 10-20 mg IV q10-20 min (bolus) or infusion 2-8 mg/min
- Arterial line placement recommended for continuous BP monitoring
- Maintain target for at least 24-72 hours

## Reversal of Anticoagulation

### Warfarin (Target INR < 1.3 within 4 hours)
- **4-factor PCC (Kcentra)**: 25-50 units/kg IV based on INR (preferred over FFP)
- **Vitamin K**: 10 mg IV over 10-20 minutes (for sustained reversal; slow onset)
- FFP 10-15 mL/kg only if PCC unavailable

### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)
- **Dabigatran**: Idarucizumab (Praxbind) 5 g IV (two 2.5 g boluses); if unavailable, use activated PCC (FEIBA) 50 units/kg
- **Rivaroxaban/Apixaban/Edoxaban**: Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) per dosing protocol; if unavailable, 4-factor PCC 50 units/kg
- Consider activated charcoal if DOAC ingested within 2 hours

### Heparin
- Protamine sulfate: 1 mg per 100 units of heparin given in previous 2-3 hours (max 50 mg)

### Antiplatelet Agents
- Platelet transfusion is **not routinely recommended** (PATCH trial showed harm)
- Consider desmopressin (DDAVP) 0.3 mcg/kg IV if aspirin-related ICH

## Surgical Indications
- **Cerebellar hemorrhage > 3 cm** with neurologic deterioration, brainstem compression, or hydrocephalus: emergent surgical evacuation
- **Lobar hemorrhage > 30 mL** within 1 cm of cortical surface: consider minimally invasive surgery (MISTIE III) or craniotomy in deteriorating patients
- **Intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus**: External ventricular drain (EVD) with or without intraventricular tPA (CLEAR III trial)
- Deep basal ganglia hemorrhage: surgery generally not beneficial
- Decompressive craniectomy may be considered for large hemorrhages with refractory elevated ICP

## Monitoring and Supportive Care
- ICU admission with neurochecks q1h for first 24 hours
- Repeat CT head at 6 hours or with any neurologic change (hematoma expansion occurs in ~30%)
- Maintain normoglycemia (glucose 140-180 mg/dL)
- Maintain normothermia (treat fever aggressively; target temp < 37.5C)
- DVT prophylaxis: pneumatic compression devices immediately; consider LMWH at 24-48 hours if hemorrhage stable
- Seizure management: treat clinical seizures; routine prophylactic antiepileptics not recommended unless lobar ICH
- Continuous EEG monitoring if decreased consciousness unexplained by hemorrhage size
