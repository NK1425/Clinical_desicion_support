# Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) - Clinical Guideline

## Definition

Gestational diabetes mellitus is glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, typically diagnosed in the second or third trimester, in patients without preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Timing
- **Universal screening** at 24-28 weeks gestation is recommended for all pregnant individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes
- **Early screening** (at first prenatal visit) for patients with risk factors: BMI >= 25, prior GDM, first-degree relative with diabetes, high-risk ethnicity, PCOS, prior macrosomic infant, HbA1c >= 5.7%

### Two-Step Approach (Preferred in US - Carpenter-Coustan Criteria)

**Step 1: 50g Glucose Challenge Test (GCT)** - non-fasting
- Positive screen: 1-hour glucose >= 130-140 mg/dL (threshold varies by institution)
- If >= 200 mg/dL, may diagnose GDM without OGTT

**Step 2: 100g 3-Hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**
- Diagnosis requires 2 or more values meeting or exceeding thresholds:
  - Fasting: >= 95 mg/dL
  - 1-hour: >= 180 mg/dL
  - 2-hour: >= 155 mg/dL
  - 3-hour: >= 140 mg/dL

### One-Step Approach (IADPSG / WHO Criteria)

**75g 2-Hour OGTT** - fasting
- Diagnosis requires 1 or more values meeting or exceeding thresholds:
  - Fasting: >= 92 mg/dL
  - 1-hour: >= 180 mg/dL
  - 2-hour: >= 153 mg/dL

## Glycemic Targets During Pregnancy

- **Fasting glucose**: < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L)
- **1-hour postprandial**: < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L)
- **2-hour postprandial**: < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L)
- **HbA1c**: < 6.0% if achievable without significant hypoglycemia

## Management

### Non-Pharmacologic (First-Line)

- **Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)**: Individualized meal plan by registered dietitian; carbohydrate-controlled diet with 3 meals and 2-3 snacks daily
- **Carbohydrate distribution**: 33-40% of total calories from carbohydrates; complex carbohydrates preferred
- **Physical activity**: 30 minutes/day moderate exercise (e.g., walking) unless obstetric contraindication
- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: Fasting and 1-hour or 2-hour postprandial after each meal (4 times/day minimum)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Initiate if glycemic targets are not achieved after 1-2 weeks of lifestyle modification.

**Insulin (Preferred)**
- No significant placental transfer; considered safest pharmacologic option
- **Basal insulin**: NPH insulin, typically at bedtime for fasting hyperglycemia
- **Prandial insulin**: Rapid-acting analogs (lispro or aspart) for postprandial hyperglycemia
- Starting dose: 0.7-1.0 units/kg/day, adjusted based on glucose patterns
- Dose requirements typically increase throughout pregnancy

**Metformin (Alternative)**
- May be considered when insulin is refused or not accessible
- Starting dose: 500 mg daily, titrate to 500 mg twice or three times daily
- Crosses the placenta; long-term offspring safety data still accumulating
- Contraindicated in preeclampsia, renal insufficiency, or fetal growth restriction

**Glyburide**
- Previously used as alternative; current evidence shows inferior outcomes compared to insulin and metformin
- Higher rates of neonatal hypoglycemia and macrosomia
- Generally not recommended as first-line alternative

## Antepartum Surveillance

- **Fetal growth ultrasound**: Every 4 weeks starting at 28-32 weeks to assess for macrosomia or growth restriction
- **Non-stress testing (NST)**: Begin at 32-36 weeks depending on severity; weekly or twice weekly
- **Kick counts**: Daily starting at 28 weeks

## Delivery Timing

- **Diet-controlled GDM**: Delivery by 39-40 weeks; avoid expectant management beyond 41 weeks
- **Medication-requiring GDM**: Delivery at 37-39 weeks depending on glycemic control and comorbidities
- Cesarean delivery should be discussed if estimated fetal weight > 4500g

## Intrapartum Glucose Management

- Target glucose 70-110 mg/dL during labor
- Monitor glucose every 1-2 hours during active labor
- Insulin infusion or dextrose infusion as needed; discontinue long-acting insulin at onset of labor

## Postpartum Follow-Up

- Discontinue all diabetes medications immediately postpartum
- **OGTT (75g, 2-hour)**: Perform at 4-12 weeks postpartum to screen for persistent diabetes or prediabetes
- Classify results using standard non-pregnant diagnostic criteria
- If postpartum OGTT is normal, screen for diabetes every 1-3 years lifelong (50% lifetime risk of T2DM)
- Encourage breastfeeding (associated with reduced future diabetes risk for mother and offspring)
- Preconception counseling before subsequent pregnancies
