# Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) - Management Guideline

## Overview

Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Lifelong exogenous insulin therapy is required. Diagnosis is supported by positive autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8, IAA) and low or undetectable C-peptide levels.

## Glycemic Targets

- **HbA1c**: < 7.0% for most adults; < 7.5% for pediatric/adolescent patients
- **Fasting/pre-meal glucose**: 80-130 mg/dL
- **Postprandial glucose (1-2 hours)**: < 180 mg/dL
- **Time in range (CGM)**: > 70% between 70-180 mg/dL
- **Time below range**: < 4% below 70 mg/dL; < 1% below 54 mg/dL

## Insulin Regimens

### Basal-Bolus (Multiple Daily Injections - MDI)

- **Basal insulin**: Insulin glargine (U-100 or U-300), insulin detemir, or insulin degludec administered once or twice daily
- **Bolus (prandial) insulin**: Rapid-acting analogs (lispro, aspart, glulisine, or ultra-rapid lispro/aspart) before meals
- **Starting total daily dose (TDD)**: 0.4-0.5 units/kg/day; 50% basal, 50% bolus divided across meals
- **Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR)**: Typically start with 1 unit per 10-15g carbohydrate; individualize based on response
- **Correction factor (ISF)**: Use 1800 rule (1800 / TDD = mg/dL drop per 1 unit rapid-acting)

### Insulin Pump Therapy (CSII)

- Delivers rapid-acting insulin continuously as basal rate with patient-initiated boluses
- Candidates: Motivated patients with frequent SMBG/CGM use, recurrent hypoglycemia, dawn phenomenon, desire for flexible lifestyle
- Basal rate: Typically 40-60% of TDD; multiple rates programmed across 24 hours
- Advantages: Reduced glycemic variability, reduced severe hypoglycemia, improved quality of life
- Requires comprehensive diabetes education and follow-up

### Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) / Closed-Loop Systems

- Hybrid closed-loop systems adjust basal insulin delivery based on CGM readings
- User still boluses for meals
- Associated with improved time in range and reduced hypoglycemia

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)

- Recommended for all adults with T1DM on intensive insulin regimens
- Real-time CGM (rtCGM): Provides continuous glucose display with trend arrows and alerts
- Intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM): Requires scanning for current glucose value
- Key metrics to review: Time in range, glucose management indicator (GMI), coefficient of variation (< 36% target)
- Calibration requirements vary by device; factory-calibrated systems preferred

## Hypoglycemia Management

### Classification
- **Level 1 (Alert)**: Glucose 54-70 mg/dL
- **Level 2 (Clinically significant)**: Glucose < 54 mg/dL
- **Level 3 (Severe)**: Altered mental status, requires third-party assistance

### Treatment
- **Conscious patient**: 15-20g fast-acting carbohydrate (glucose tablets, juice); recheck in 15 minutes; repeat if still < 70 mg/dL (Rule of 15)
- **Unconscious/unable to swallow**: Glucagon 1 mg IM/SC or nasal glucagon 3 mg; IV dextrose 25g (D50W 50 mL) if IV access available
- All patients should have glucagon prescribed and household members trained

### Prevention
- Review insulin doses, timing, physical activity, alcohol intake
- Set CGM low glucose alerts at 70-80 mg/dL
- Pre-exercise carbohydrate intake or basal rate reduction (pump)

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Prevention

- Never discontinue basal insulin, even when not eating
- Sick day management rules: Check blood glucose every 2-4 hours; check ketones if glucose > 250 mg/dL
- Increase fluid intake; supplement with rapid-acting insulin for correction
- Seek emergency care if persistent vomiting, ketones > 1.5 mmol/L (blood), or inability to maintain hydration
- Patients on SGLT2 inhibitors (off-label in T1DM) are at risk for euglycemic DKA

## Screening for Complications

- Follow T2DM screening protocols starting 5 years after diagnosis (or at puberty)
- Annual dilated eye exam, foot exam, renal function, lipid panel
- Screen for thyroid disease (TSH annually) and celiac disease at diagnosis and if symptomatic
- Assess for diabetes distress and depression at routine visits

## Adjunctive Therapies

- Pramlintide (amylin analog): May reduce postprandial glucose excursions and weight; requires meal-dose insulin reduction
- SGLT2 inhibitors: Not FDA-approved for T1DM; if used, monitor closely for euglycemic DKA
